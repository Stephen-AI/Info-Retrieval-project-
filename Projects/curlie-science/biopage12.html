            successful at retarding aging, and applying this knowledge to extend 
            the healthy lifespan of humans. These animals include rockfish, 
            turtles and whales, all documented to live 200 years or longer

            and more age-related problems. Because of our aging population, the

            style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>Aging research has advanced 
            dramatically in the last several years, with many recent discoveries 
            about the biochemical and genetic components of aging. But 
            curiously, one potential area of study for aging research identified 
            over 70 years ago has not advanced until recently - the analysis of 
            long-lived animals. In the 1930's it was proposed that some fish do 
            not show signs of senescence (Bidder 1932). Even though biological 
            tools such as histology existed at that time, no known efforts were 
            made to examine these animals. <br><br>This new area of study in 
            biomedical gerontology has the potential to reveal the genetic and 
            biochemical processes that long-lived animals use to retard aging. 
            Although rockfish (genus Sebastes) have been the main focus, one of 
            our studies is on turtles, and whales are under consideration for 
            future studies. Leonard Hayflick, discoverer of the "Hayflick limit" 
            of cellular senescence and an advisor to this project, states that 
            "Guerin's project is not only unique, but probes an area of almost 
            total neglect in biogerontology, yet an area with more promise to 
            deliver valuable data than, perhaps, any 
            other".<br><br><strong><span 
            style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: teal">Background on Negligible 
            Senescence:</span></strong><br>Caleb Finch at USC coined the term 
            "negligible senescence" to describe very slow or negligible aging 
            (Finch 1990). He listed several animals with this characteristic, 
            including rockfish, sturgeon, turtles, bivalves and possibly 
            lobsters. Later in a paper from the first Symposium on Organisms 
            with Slow Aging (which the Director of this project also spoke at), 
            Finch further described criteria to test the occurrence of 
            negligible aging. These include no observable age-related increase 
            in mortality rate or decrease in reproduction rate after maturity, 
            and no observable age-related decline in physiological capacity or 
            disease resistance (Finch and Austad 2001). <br><br>Accurate age 
            determination is important in studying long-lived animals. In 
            turtles, the determination of minimum age is relatively 
            straightforward, using tag and recapture methods. In many fish, the 
            most common technique is the analysis of annual growth rings in the 
            otolith, or ear bone (Bagenal 1974, McFarlane and Beamish 1995). Two 
            recent international symposia have focused entirely on the 
            importance of otolith measurement in fish life history studies 
            (Secor et al. 1995, Fossum et al. 2000). Another technique used by 
            fisheries management to provide an independent age estimate is the 
            radiometric approach, which utilizes a known radioactive decay 
            series in the core of bones (Bennett et al. 1982, Campana et al. 
            1990). Recent research that showed whales live over 200 years in 
            good health used aspartic acid racemization (George 
            1999).<br><br>Zoos have also compiled longevity information. 
            Alligators have been recorded up to eighty years of age, although it 
            is uncertain if death was due to senescence or environmental factors 
            (Snider, A.T., Bowler, J.K. Longevity of Reptiles and Amphibians in 
            North American Collections 1992, and also personal communication 
            with the Cincinnati Zoo 2001). Green sea turtles have been estimated 
            to take up to a maximum of 50 years to reach maturity in the wild, 
            due to their low protein diet (Bjorndal 1985). This is significant 
            because delayed reproduction is usually associated with a very slow 
            rate of aging. A 1994 issue of Gerontology was devoted to aging in 
            cold-blooded vertebrates; it compiled research showing that even 
            though some fish are long-lived, interestingly many are short-lived 
            and have senescence similar to that seen in mammals (Patnaik, B.K. 
            (Ed.), 1994).<br><br>Many of the above mentioned animals were 
            originally considered for the initial study of negligible 
            senescence. But in 1997 the project received data from the Alaska 
            Fish and Game on randomly sampled Yelloweye rockfish, commercially 
            caught off of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city 
            w:st="on">Sitka</st1:city>, <st1:state 
            w:st="on">Alaska</st1:state></st1:place>. The charts they provided 
            showed that 16% of the fish going to people's dinner tables were 50 
            years of age or older, with several over 100 years old! With the 
            knowledge that long-lived animals of this age were commercially 
            available, rockfish became the major research effort of the 
            AgelessAnimals project.<br><img id="_x0000_i1026" border="0"

            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In a very intriguing analysis, 
            the project's Fish Ecologist, Gregor M. Cailliet, determined that 
            rockfish have both short-lived and long-lived members in the same 
            genus (Cailliet 2001). He found that maximum rockfish longevity 
            ranges in age from 12 years for the calico rockfish to 205 years for 
            the rougheye rockfish. Future studies on the project will compare 
            genetic and biochemical measurements between short-lived and 
            long-lived rockfish.</span></p>
