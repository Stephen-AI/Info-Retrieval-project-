  </font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem of geometrization 
  of the language of chemistry, to the best of our knowledge, has been formulated, 
  grounded and partially solved for the first time in [1]. This state of the art 
  is the reason for publications in this topic to be lacking till now. This fact 
  indicates that the large number of problems, related to investigation of the 
  logical structure of the language of chemistry and the logically correct definition 
  of its notions and relations, as well as to the formalization and the mathematical 
  modeling of these notions and relations, has been ignored so far with the result 
  that the problem of geometrization of the language of chemistry has not been 
  formulated and, even less, solved. It is clear that the solution of aforesaid 
  problems is very important for the development and the progress of the language 
  of every science, including that of chemistry. To our opinion, these problems 
  have been ignored due partially to the theoretical chemistry being so far strongly 
  and continuously concentrated mainly on studying the relationships between the 
  structure of chemical notions and that of quantum physics. Thus, the simplified 
  opinion that the theoretical chemistry is just applied quantum mechanics is 
  now commonly accepted. This opinion, however, is not only quite simplified and 
  rather is totally wrong. We are going to demonstrate this point of view in several 
  papers. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main aims of this paper 
  are: (1) to formulate and ground the problem of geometrization of the language 
  of chemistry in a general form and to outline the way of its solution in a set 
  of four basic problems; (2) to present briefly some results discussed in detail 
  in [1].</font></p>
<hr width="100%">
<p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#FF0000">FORMULATION 
  AND GROUNDING OF THE PROBLEM: THREE BASIC EVOLUTIONARY HYPOTHESIS </font></b></font> 
</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One general concept for 
  the existence of qualitatively differing evolutionary stages in the development 
  of the scientific knowledge is formulated in [1]. This conception enables to 
  formulate in a general form and to ground strictly enough the more particular 
  problem for geometrization of the language of chemistry. That is why in order 
  to formulate and ground this problem we shall formulate some of the basic hypothesis 
  in this evolutionary concept and clarify the meaning of some notions. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The evolution of the scientific 
  cognition about various groups of phenomena obeys rigorous laws, which can be 
  found by analyzing the different evolutionary stages of the most developed sciences. 
  The knowledge of these laws makes it possible to determine the main trends of 
  developement for a science at a lower evolutionary stage. Even fragmentary, 
  such a knowledge allows to formulate the main evolutionary problems to be solved 
  for each less developed science during the forthcoming stage of its evolution. 
  If we accept the aforesaid concept as a first basic hypothesis, and analyze 
  the stages passed through by such sciences as geometry and physics, advanced 
  in their evolution, we shall find that the knowledge about the groups of phenomena 
  studied by them has developed towards the creation of axiomatically formulated 
  theories which describe the respective groups of phenomena in terms of entirely 
  mathematical spatial concepts and models. Let us accept as a second basic hypothesis 
  that this trend of development reveals one of the main laws directing the evolution 
  of scientific knowledge. Then, this law would also rule the development of chemistry. 
  However, to the best of our knowledge, neither an axiomatically formulated theory 
  describing the chemical phenomena through entirely mathematical spatial concepts 
  and models has been proposed so far, nor the problem of the creation of such 
  theories has been formulated in any detail. On the contrary, it is known that 
  even D. Mendeleev, the discoverer of the periodic law, has thought it impossible 
  to transform chemistry in a science like geometry [2]. Being overconcentrated 
  on quantum mechanics the contemporary theoretical chemistry also totally ignores 
  these problems. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to clarify the 
  meaning of the aforesaid hypotheses we shall clarify the meaning of some important 
  notions. So, by the term axiomatization one usually means the process of investigation 
  of the logical structure of a given scientific language, the correct formulation 
  of its notions and relations, as well as the construction of axiomatic formulations 
  of the different systems of logically consentient and non-contradictory statements 
  of this science. By formulating the problem of axiomatization of a given scientific 
  language it enters, in fact, the highest evolutionary stage, reached so far 
  by the most developed sciences [3]. On the other hand, the term geometrization 
  means usually such a reformulation of the statements of a given science that 
  uses entirely mathematical spatial notions and models. It should be accentuated 
  that the geometrization of a given scientific language is impossible without 
  its preliminary axiomatization. At the same time, the geometrization facilitates 
  substantially the further axiomatization of the corresponding scientific language. 
  In brief, these two processes are inextricably bound up each other and we consider 
  them as being parts of one and the same process. We refer to this process later 
  on as geometrization and define by this generalized term the process of transformation 
  of the language of a given science in a set of such axiomatic formulations of 
  the systems of logically consentient and non-contradictory statements of this 
  science that is characterized by a large-scale use of entirely mathematical 
  notions and models. By this generalized term we have tried to denote shortly 
  and to point the main trend in the development of each science during a given 
  strictly specified evolutionary stage referred to us as the stage of geometrization 
  of the language of this science. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is clear from the above 
  said that the concept of geometrization of a given scientific language should 
  be regarded in the most general sense of the term geometry. Classical examples 
  for a final result of completed geometrization in the generalized meaning of 
  this term are the formulations of different kinds of geometry [4, 5, 6, etc.]. 
  Examples for well advanced geometrization are the mathematical formulations 
  of many physical disciplines such as classical and quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, 
  theory of relativity, electrodynamics, etc. [7, 8, 9, etc.]. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, if our two basic 
  hypotheses are true, chemistry is still on a lower stage of development as compared 
  to geometry and physics. So, as a third basic hypothesis we accept that the 
  main evolutionary problem for the contemporary chemistry is the problem of geometrization 
  of its language in the above mentioned meaning. By formulating and solving this 
  problem chemistry enters a qualitatively new stage of development, namely the 
  stage of its geometrization. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a matter of fact, the 
  problem of geometrization of the language of chemistry is a huge problem, the 
  solution of which requires the sustained efforts of lots of researchers. We 
  think, however, that the moment is ripe for this problem to be submitted for 
  discussion, and this is the main aim of the present work.</font></p>
<hr width="100%">
<p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> <font color="#FF0000">OUTLINING 
  OF THE WAY OF GEOMETRIZATION OF CHEMISTRY </font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Up to here we have formulated 
  and grounded in a general form the problem of geometrization of the language 
  of chemistry. Now, we shall trace out, in general, the way to solve it. It is 
  clear from the definition of the generalized notion geometrization that to solve 
  this problem one should find the solution of the following&nbsp;<a NAME="system_of_four_basic_problems"></a>system 
  of four basic problems, inextricably bound up with each other: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.</b> To reveal the 
    logical structure of the language of chemistry in order to formulate correctly 
    the chemical notions and relations; </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2.</b> To construct 
    entirely mathematical spatial representations of these notions and relations; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>3. </b>To formulate 
    systems of logically consentient, non-contradictory and veracious chemical 
    statements playing the role of axiomatics in further axiomatic formulations 
    of the language of chemistry; </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>4.</b> To prove logically 
    the truth of those chemical statements which are not axioms, i.e. these statements 
    to be deduced from the formulated chemical axiomes. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several aspects of the 
  aforesaid problems require a brief discussion in order to clarify their meaning 
  and to introduce the context main needed: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The structure of basic 
    chemical notions and relationships cannot yet be considered as entirely completed. 
    This fact is illustrated by the existence and the continuous appearance of 
    numerous nonequivalent representations of the Periodic law [10, 11, 12, etc.]. 
    Thus, the mathematical modeling of the structure of basic chemical notions 
    and relationships must start by the analysis of the logical structure of the 
    language of chemistry. On the other side, due to the strong relation between 
    the basic notions of each science, the mathematical modeling of every well-defined 
    basic notion simplifies to a great extent the analysis of the logical structure 
    of the language of this science and the correct definition of all other notions 
    therein</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Even a cursory analysis 
    [1] shows that the current language of chemistry is logically imperfect. <a href="#1_Note">For 
    example, there are considerable omissions, meaning anachronisms, a number 
    of basic chemical notions are neither defined explicitly nor correctly and, 
    in some cases, there are important differences between the definitions used 
    by different authors<sup>1</sup></a>. In general, the language of chemistry 
    is logically structureless and there is no a clear separation between the 
    basic and derivative notions. It should be noted that logical imperfections 
    are normal for scientific languages undergoing transition from a “lower, inductive 
    stage” to a ”higher, deductive stage” and to ”the most higher (supreme), axiomatic 
    stage” of its evolution [3]. Therefore, the elimination of these imperfections 
    is one of the basic problems to be solved during the deductive and axiomatic 
    stages of development of a science.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The problem of the 
    logical investigation and the correct formulation of a particular structure 
    of scientific notions and relations is closely related to the problem of its 
    mathematical modeling. That is why both problems should be solved simultaneously.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The formulation and 
    the solution of these roblems enables the transition of chemistry from a lower 
    inductive stage to a higher deductive stage of its evolution.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Though new for chemistry, 
    the problems of the logical investigation, the correct formulation and the 
    mathematical modeling of a particular structure of notions and relations are 
    well known for mathematics and logics. That is why, by formuling of these 
    problems, the language of chemistry is “set in the context” of mathematics 
    and logics.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adequate logical and 
    mathematical tools must be used for solving the aforesaid problems. These 
    include: explicit and correct formulation of different notions and statements 
    of scientific language under study; use of tools such as the axiomatic method, 
    mathematical modeling, etc.; use of logical classificational categories such 
    as definition, axiom, theorem, lemma, corollary, etc.; introduction of adequate 
    symbols for the notions of this system, and so on.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Particular objects of 
    the same <a href="#2_Note">species<sup>2</sup></a> are not subject of chemistry 
    because of their equivalence. In other words, the principle of equivalence, 
    known in quantum mechanics, holds also in chemistry. It should be noted that 
    this principle, in general, is one of the basic axioms in the scientific knowledge.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is evident from the 
    last comment that subjects of chemistry are sets of equivalent objects, rather 
    than particular elements of these sets. Thus, the category <a href="#2_Note">species</a> 
    is the basic classificational category in chemical taxonomy (that is why common 
    for chemistry is the usage of notions such as species of atoms, species of 
    ionized atoms, species of polyatomic ions, species of molecules, etc.), and 
    an extended exploitation of the theory of sets is necessary to geometrization 
    of chemistry.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The complete solution of 
  the aforesaid system of basic problems is by no means an easy task in both its 
  large scale and variety. So, in the study performed [1] we confined ourselves 
  to find out such rigorous partial solutions to the first three problems that 
  would demonstrate that the problem of the geometrization of chemistry is solvable.</font></p>

  OF THE MAIN RESULTS </font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main results presented 
  in detail in [1] are: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1) </b>A brief analysis 
    was carried out of the logical structure of the fundamentals of chemistry. 
    It was found out that they can be separated into four parts, in each of which 
    a corresponding group of basic chemical notions was introduced. (See [13]). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2)</b> A method for 
    forming spatial mathematical representations of the basic chemical notions 
    and relationships was developed. </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>3)</b> Using this 
    method we have constructed and analyzed one approximate and two more precise 
    spatial mathematical models of the set S of different species of atoms which 
    are at the same time mathematical models of three different tabular forms 
    of the Periodic System. (See [13]). </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>4)</b> In constructing 
    the approximate model <img SRC="Pf(S,T0).gif" height=18 width=86 align=middle> 
    we started from a simplified tabular short form of the Periodic System, denoted 
    as T<sub>0</sub>. This table represents only the most general characteristics 
    of the Periodic law (i.e. the ordering of chemical elements in groups and 
    periods, as well as the ordering of the groups and the periods), but does 
    not represent the atoms of chemical elements belonging to the corresponding 
    A or B subgroups. In constructing and analyzing the approximate model we have 
    achieved the following goals: (i) the main concepts and the most significant 
    mathematical elements, necessary for the construction of the more precise 
    mathematical models of the basic chemical notions and relationships, were 
    introduced; (ii) the developed method was demonstrated. Briefly, by the approximate 
    model we have introduced and demonstrated the main part of tools, necessary 
    for the geometrization of the language of chemistry. </font></p>

  The lack of notions for classifying chemical objects in presence or absence 
  of chemical structure is an example of omission. The identification of the notion 
  species of atoms with the notion chemical element is a typical example of meaningful 
  anachronism in the language of contemporary chemistry. For example, incorrect 
  are the definitions of ionization, recombination and the oxidation number.</font></p>

  Species in this study means the major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded 
  as the basic category of chemical classification. This is in accordance with 
  the Random House Webster’s meanings: 1) Logic. a) one of the classes of things 
  included with other classes in a genus. b) the set of things within one of these 
  classes. 2) the major subdivision of a genus or subgenus, regarded as the basic
