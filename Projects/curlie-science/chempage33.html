        Once you've been in the MRI field for any length of time, you start hearing all of the various horror stories about things that have flown into a scanner. Often, newcomers don't take the real danger of flying objects seriously until they witness an oxygen tank or gurney flying into a magnet themselves. This page will contain a collection of pictures and stories of metalic projectiles. Please show this page to all MRI newcomers, for their own safety and the safety of their patients!</p>
    
    <p>Please send any pictures and/or stories you have to moriel@simplyphysics.com. Let me know if you don't mind having your name posted with the picture/story or if you would rather remain anonymous (out of embarrassment?)</p>
    
    <p>For FAR MORE information on MRI safety issues, I recommend you go to Dr. Frank Shellock's site <a href="www.MRIsafety.com">www.MRIsafety.com.</a></p></div>

    We made it a habit to bring chairs into the room but kept them at “x” distance.  The story was after the procedure the patient pulled the chair closer while getting up.  The chair was pulled to the magnet.  The tech went to get assistance to pull the chair off and enlisted the help of a transporter who decided to start pulling before everyone was assembled.  The chair flipped up and in and history was made. 
     
    This happened on the 3-11 shift.  The next morning all were assembled to brainstorm.  Maintenance drilled a hole in the concrete and placed an eye screw.  A winch was located outside the room and with a nylon rope the chair was pulled off.  After GE‘s assessment and okay, we were up and running by noon or 1pm!  We were impressed that this was accomplished without a quench and significant downtime. 
     
    The shroud was cracked and the head coil was damaged; both replaced at a later time.  The patient was not injured.
      
    After 20 years and no accidents, our policy was immediately changed to stop allowing the chairs into the scan room.  We recognize we were VERY lucky in many respects. " href="assets/img/safety/flying_objects/Basketchair.jpg">

    My Favorite Horror Story
    Here's one I heard from an Oxford Magnets engineer which was later independently verified by a technologist who had been hired to work at this site.
    
    A brand new magnet had just finished being installed into a brand new building. All of the acceptance testing had been completed and the magnet was to be turned over to the customer the very next day. There was only one minor problem to be dealt with first. One of the sprinklers in the scan room had a tiny leak. A welder was brought in to fix the leak but somebody forgot to tell him that the magnet was at field. So..... in walks this welder with his acetyene torch system. His tank flies into the magnet, the valve breaks off, sparks and catches fire. Since he was in there to fix a leak in the sprinkler system, it had been turned off first. The brand new building burned to the ground!
    
    Sorry, I don't have any pictures.
    
    If anyone knows if I have any of the details wrong, I'd appreciate them letting me know." href="assets/img/safety/flying_objects/WeldTank1.jpg">

She asked if she could sit down while the tech was entering data into the computer. So the tech let her sit in one of the console chairs. Since the woman was rather tired, the technologist pushed the patient into the room on the chair. Since this was an actively shielded magnet, she thought it would be OK. The patient got off the chair, sat on the table and gave the chair a little push with her feet. The chair rolled away and just kept right on rolling on a curved path to the magnet bore and flew right in. Fortunately, no one was hurt but it took almost a full day to ramp the magnet down, pull the chair out, ramp back up and check out the system." href="assets/img/safety/flying_objects/chair.jpg">
