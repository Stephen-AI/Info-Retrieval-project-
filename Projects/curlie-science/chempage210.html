It is fired at cone 05 creating a super gloss. This is applied very, very thickly (double the thickness of what a stoneware glaze would be). Yet notice how the air-vent holes did not heal during firing, these would have filled in easily had this been on stoneware or porcelain. For this reason, majolica glazes must be applied to ware not having any abrupt concave contours (this also happened on the handle-joins and where foot-meets-wall inside). Bisque must be clean to assure good adherence. Any glaze coverage issues must be repaired carefully before firing. This piece was bisque fired at cone 06, that is the reason for the air vent holes. Had it been bisque fired at cone 04 (higher than the glaze firing) these would not have occurred. However that would have extended the dip-time, this one was held under 10 seconds whereas a cone 04 bisque would have required 20 seconds.</span></div><p class="TimeLineLinks"><span class="TimeLineNote">Context: </span><a  title="Pictures" href="https://insight-live.com/show_post.php?pz=1PfejDbfza">For even coverage white majolica glazes must be applied by dipping</a>, <a  title="Glossary" href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_melt_fluidity.html">Melt Fluidity</a>, <a  title="Glossary" href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_majolica.html">Majolica</a></p><p class="TimeLineDate">Wednesday 31st July 2019</p></div><div style="padding:0px 0px 10px 0px; clear:left;"><a target="_blank" href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/reference/images/pictures/mwc9kwumeq.jpg"><img width="200px" style="float:left; padding:0px 15px 10px 0px" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/reference/images/pictures/mwc9kwumeq-400W.jpg" /></a>

Drying was required after doing the inside coats, so the total glazing time was several hours. The glaze layer is way too thin and it is not even at all!  The one on the right was dipped in a 5 gallon bucket-full of Arbuckle white (that was weighed out according to a recipe and slurried at 1.62 <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:none;" href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_specific_gravity.html" target="_blank">specific gravity</a>). It took seconds to dip-apply, the thickness is good and I got very even coverage. As is obvious, it makes sense to make your own base white. Then, you can decorate using the overglaze colors (I use the Spectrum Majolica series). Another advantage of making your own white is that you can splurge on the amount of <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:none;" href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_opacifier_opacification.html" target="_blank">opacifier</a> (in this case 9% zircon and 4% tin oxide), to achieve maximum whiteness and opacity.

So I glazed it only on the inside. That created a time-bomb waiting for hot coffee! Three others did exactly the same. Four other mugs glazed on the outside were fine. Why? Glazes need to have a lower <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:none;" href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_co-efficient_of_thermal_expansion.html" target="_blank">thermal expansion</a> than the body so they do not <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:none;" href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_crazing.html" target="_blank">craze</a> over time. When ware is glazed inside and the compressive forces the glaze finds itself under keep it crack free and also significantly strengthens the piece (like pre-stressed concrete). But here there is no outside glaze to be counteract the inside one pushing outward. When suddenly heated it pushes even harder. Structural weak points, outside surface imperfections or pronounced contour or thickness changes provide crack-initiation-points to relieve the stress. The only way to make this inside-only-glazed technique work is carefully tuning the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:none;" href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_co-efficient_of_thermal_expansion.html" target="_blank">thermal expansion</a> of the inside glaze. That means a lot of testing and a lot of broken pieces.</span></div><p class="TimeLineLinks"><span class="TimeLineNote">Context: </span><a target="_blank" title="Glossary" href="https://digitalfire.com/4sight/glossary/glossary_glaze_compression.html">Glaze Compression</a></p><p class="TimeLineDate">Wednesday 24th July 2019</p></div><div style="padding:0px 0px 10px 0px; clear:left;"><a target="_blank" href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/reference/images/pictures/ex629d6s81.jpg"><img width="200px" style="float:left; padding:0px 15px 10px 0px" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/reference/images/pictures/ex629d6s81-400W.jpg" /></a>
<h3 class="TimeLineTitle">What is the temperature difference between these two cones?</h3><div class="TimeLineDescrip">Four degrees F. I was consistently getting the cone on the left using a custom programmed firing schedule to 2204F. However Orton recommends that the tip of the self supporting cone should be even with the top of the base, not the bottom.

<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; I have visited your website for many years to get ceramic information - your website is excellent ... Thanks again for all the great info on your website - hopefully one day I can repay you for your outstanding resourse.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; Many Solution Regarding Ceramic Problems Got From Your Website.Thank You Very Much.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; Thanks for your website! I found it greatly informative and useful in my research work on high temperature ceramic materials.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; I would also like to say thank you for providing the information about glaze's that you have on your websight. I have been formulating glaze for 20+ years, read practicaly every book on glaze & glass and your web page's had better information than any book.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; 'we have been using the arabia blue and white variation of the 5X20 cone 6 glaze, and have had a great response from our customers. Thanks for your efforts - you have made a believer out of me!"</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; Your web is great!</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; I'm excited to get started learning how to use the program. I've drawn much from your online glaze chemistry information over the years, and now I hope to apply some of that knowledge effectively.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; WOW, WOW, WHAT GREAT INFO! thankyou! I am going to pass your site on to someone i know who is more keen on the science of glazes, than the potting, unlike me... she will love your test works and pics   Wow! Thanks again.  </p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; I join others (I'm sure) in thanking Tony for the incredible resource that is the digital fire library, and for the insight glaze calculation software and now website. Not a week goes by when I don't use all three of them and usually quite extensively.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; I love insight BTW. I have been showing everyone at Alfred how easy it is to do UMF while comparing two recipes next to each other. The up and down toggles make it easy to understand cause and effect. They are also impressed how easily i can switch between my computer and smartphone and maintain all my work and recipes.
BTW I just love insight. It has changed my experience and knowledge of glazes drastically.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; I'd just like to say that I love Digital Fire and I'm on here pretty much everyday. It has been soo helpful. Even though I am still leaning and exploring what I can do with the program it has been a huge help, and I believe it will be for years to come.  I'm such a fan of your glaze software and tell all them members here .. what a tremendous asset it is to my practice. </p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; Hello Mr. Hansen.  Your digitalfire.com site is AMAZING!  I use it considerably.  Thank you so much for all the information you offer!  I tell all my students and friends in clay to come here to learn.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; BTW, thanks for creating such a great site.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:10px; text-indent:-10px;">&bull; I have really been enjoying using insight.</p>
