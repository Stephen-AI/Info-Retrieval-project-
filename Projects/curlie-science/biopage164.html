Ever since Darwin came out with his theory of evolution, people -
including
Darwin himself -- have been speculating on how our social behaviors
(and
feelings, attitudes, and so on) might also be affected by
evolution.&nbsp;
After all, if the way our bodies look and work as biological creatures
can be better understood through evolution, why not the things we do
with
those bodies?
<p>The entemologist E. O Wilson was the first to formalize the idea
that
social behavior could be explained evolutionarily, and he called his
theory
sociobiology.&nbsp; At first, it gained attention only in biological
circles
-- even there it had strong critics.&nbsp; When sociologists and
psychologists
caught wind of it, the controversy really got started.&nbsp; At that
time,
sociology was predominantly structural-functionalist, with a smattering
of Marxists and feminists.&nbsp; Psychology was still dominated by
behaviorist
learning theory, with humanism starting to make some headway.&nbsp; Not
one of these theories has much room for the idea that we, as human
beings,
could be so strongly determined by evolutionary biology!
</p>
<p>Over time, Wilson's sociobiology found more and more supporters
among
biologists, psychologists, and even anthropologists.&nbsp; Only
sociology
has remained relatively unaffected.
</p>
<p><b>Instinct</b>
</p>
<p>Let's begin with an example of instinctual behavior in
animals:&nbsp;
The <b>three-spined stickleback</b> is a one-inch long fish that one
can
find in the rivers and lakes of Europe.&nbsp; Springtime is, as you
might
expect, the mating season for the mighty stickleback and the perfect
time
to see instincts in action.
</p>
<p>Certain changes occur in their appearances:&nbsp; The male, normally
dull, becomes red above the midline.&nbsp; He stakes out a territory
for
himself, from which he will chase any similarly colored male, and
builds
a nest by depositing weeds in a small hollow and running through them
repeatedly
to make a tunnel.&nbsp; This is all quite built-in.&nbsp; Males raised
all alone will do the same.&nbsp; We find, in fact, that the male
stickleback
will, in the mating season, attempt to chase anything red from his
territory
(including the reflection of a red truck on the aquarium's glass).
</p>
<p>But that's not the instinct of the moment.&nbsp; The female
undergoes
a transformation as well:&nbsp; She, normally dull like the male,
becomes
bloated by her many eggs and takes on a certain silvery glow that
apparently
no male stickleback can resist.&nbsp; When he sees a female, he will
swim
towards her in a zigzag pattern.&nbsp; She will respond by swimming
towards
him with her head held high.&nbsp; He responds by dashing towards his
nest
and indicating it's entrance.&nbsp; She enters the nest, her head
sticking
out one end, her tail the other.&nbsp; He prods at the base of her tail
with rhythmic thrusts.&nbsp; She releases her eggs and leaves the
nest.&nbsp;
He enters and fertilizes the eggs, and then, a thorough chauvinist,
chases
her away and waits for a new partner.
</p>
<p>What you see working here is a series of <b>sign stimuli</b> and <b>fixed
actions</b>:&nbsp; His zigzag dance is a response to her appearance and
becomes a stimulus for her to follow, and so on.&nbsp; Perhaps I'm
being
perverse, but doesn't the stickleback's instinctive courtship remind
you
of some of our human courtship rituals?&nbsp; I'm not trying to say we
are quite as mindless about it as the stickleback seems to be -- just
that
some similar patterns may form a part of or basis for our more complex,
learned behaviors.
</p>
<p><b>Ethologists</b> -- people who study animal behavior in natural
settings
-- have been studying behaviors such as the sticklebacks' for over a
century.&nbsp;
One, Konrad Lorenz, has developed an hydraulic model of how an instinct
works.&nbsp; We have a certain amount of energy available for any
specific
instinctual system, as illustrated by a reservoir of water.&nbsp; There
is a presumably neurological mechanism that allows the release of some
or all of that energy in the presence of the appropriate sign
stimulus:&nbsp;
a faucet.&nbsp; There are further mechanisms -- neurological, motor,
hormonal
-- that translate the energy into specific fixed actions.&nbsp; Today,
we might suggest that hydraulic energy is a poor metaphor and translate
the whole system into an information processing one -- each era has
it's
favorite metaphors.&nbsp; But the description still seems sound.
</p>
<p>Does any of this apply to human courtship and sexual behavior?&nbsp;
I leave it up to you.&nbsp; But what about other examples?&nbsp; Two
possibilities
stand out:
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; There are certain patterns of behavior found in most, if
not
all, animals, involving the promotion of oneself, the search for status
or raw power, epitomized in aggression.&nbsp; Let's call this <b>the
assertive
instinct</b>.
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; There are other patterns of behavior found in, it seems,
somewhat
fewer species, involving care for someone other than oneself,
epitomized
in a mother's care for her babies.&nbsp; Let's call this the <b>nurturant
instinct</b>.
</p>
<p><b>Evolution</b>
</p>
<p>The basics of evolution are quite simple.&nbsp; First, all animals
tend
to over-reproduce, some having literally thousands of offspring in a
lifetime.&nbsp;
Yet populations of animals tend to remain quite stable over the
generations.&nbsp;
Obviously, some of these offspring aren't making it!
</p>
<p>Second, There is quite a bit of variation within any species.&nbsp;
Much of the variety is genetically based and passed on from one
generation
to another.&nbsp; Included in that variety are traits that help some
individuals
to survive and reproduce, and other traits that hinder them.
</p>
<p>Put the two ideas together, and you have <b>natural selection</b>:&nbsp;
Nature encourages the propagation of the positive traits and
discourages
the negative ones.&nbsp; As long as variety continues to be created by
sexual recombination and mutation, and the resources for life remain
limited,
evolution will continue.
</p>
<p>One sociobiologist, David Barash, suggests a guiding question for
understanding
possible evolutionary roots of any behavior:&nbsp; "Why is sugar
sweet&#8221;,
that is, why do we find it attractive?&nbsp; One hypothesis is that our
ancestors ate fruit to meet their nutritional needs.&nbsp; Fruit is
most
nutritious when it is ripe.&nbsp; When fruit is ripe, it is loaded with
sugars.&nbsp; Any ancestor who had a taste for sugar would be a little
more likely to eat ripe fruit.&nbsp; His or her resulting good health
would
make him or her stronger and more attractive to potential mates.&nbsp;
He or she might leave more offspring who, inheriting this taste for
ripe
fruit, would be more likely to survive to reproductive age,
etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A more general form of the guiding question is to ask of any motivated
behavior "How might that behavior have aided ancestral survival and/or
reproduction?"
</p>
<p>A curious point to make about the example used is that today we have
refined sugar -- something which was not available to our ancestors,
but
which we discovered and passed on to our descendants through learned
culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is clear that today a great attraction to sugar no longer serves our
survival and reproduction.&nbsp; But culture moves much more quickly

than
evolution:&nbsp; It took millions of years to evolve our healthy taste
for sugar; it took only thousands of years to undermine it.
</p>
<p><b>Attraction</b>
</p>
<p>Let's start by looking at mate selection.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious
that we are attracted some people more than others.&nbsp;
Sociobiologists
have the same explanation for this as for everything else, based on the
archetypal question "why is sugar sweet?"&nbsp; We should be sexually
attracted
to others whose characteristics would maximize our genetic success,
that
is, would give us many healthy, long-lived, fertile children.
</p>
<p>We should find healthiness attractive and, conversely, illness
unattractive.&nbsp;
We should find "perfect" features attractive, and deformities
unattractive.&nbsp;
We should find vitality, strength, vigor attractive.&nbsp; We should
find
"averageness" attractive -- not too short, not too tall, not too fat,
not
too thin....&nbsp; Quasimodo, for all his decency, had a hard time
getting
dates.
</p>
<p>We are also attracted to certain people for less "logical" reasons,
such as the degree to which they have strong masculine or feminine
physical
-- and behavioral -- characteristics.&nbsp; Women prefer men who are
taller,
with broad shoulders, a square jaw....&nbsp; Men prefer women who are
shorter
than themselves, softer, rounder....
</p>
<p>These differences between the sexes is known as <b>sexual dimorphism</b>,
and the process that leads to these differences is called <b>sexual
selection.&nbsp;</b>
Small functional differences between the sexes can become large
nonfunctional
ones over many generations.&nbsp; If female birds are instinctively
inclined
to prefer colorful males -- perhaps because colorful males have served
to distract predators from ancestral females and their chicks -- then a
male that is more colorful will have a better chance, and the female
with
a more intense attraction to color a better chance, and their offspring
will inherit their colors and intense attraction to colors and so on
and
so on... until you reach a point where the colors and the attraction
are
no longer a plus, but become a minus, such as in the birds of
paradise.&nbsp;
Some males cannot even fly under the weight of all their plumage.
</p>
<p>Human beings are only modestly dimorphic.&nbsp; But boy are we aware
of the dimorphisms!
</p>
<p>The dimorphism is also found in our behaviors.&nbsp; David Barash
puts
it so: "Males tend to be selected for salesmanship; females for sales
resistance."&nbsp;
Females have a great deal invested in any act of copulation:&nbsp; the
limited number of offspring she can carry, the dangers of pregnancy and
childbirth, the increased nutritional requirements, the danger from
predators...all
serve to make the choice of a mate an important consideration.&nbsp;
Males,
on the other hand, can and do walk away from the consequences of
copulation.&nbsp;
Note, for example, the tendency of male frogs to try to mate with
wading
boots:&nbsp; As long as some sperm gets to where it should, the male is
doing alright.
</p>
<p>So females tend to more fussy about who they have relations
with.&nbsp;
They are more sensitive to indications that a particular male will
contribute
to their genetic survival.&nbsp; One of the most obvious examples is
the
attention many female animals pay to the size and strength of males,
and
the development of specialized contests, such as those of antlered and
horned animals, to demonstrate that strength.
</p>
<p>There are less obvious things as well.&nbsp; In some animals, males
have to show, not just strength, but the ability to provide.&nbsp; This
is especially true in any species which has the male providing for the
female during her pregnancy and lactation -- like humans!&nbsp;
Sociobiologists
suggest that, while men find youth and physical form most attractive,
women
tend to look for indications of success, solvency, savoir-faire.&nbsp;
It might not just be a cultural fluke that men bring flowers and
candies,
pay for dinner, and so forth.
</p>
<p>Further, they suggest, women may find themselves more interested in
the "mature" man, as he is more likely to have proven himself, and less
interested in the "immature" man, who presents a certain risk.&nbsp;
And
women should be more likely to put up with polygyny (i.e. other wives)
than men with polyandry (other husbands):&nbsp; Sharing a clearly
successful
man is better in come cases than having a failure all to
yourself.&nbsp;
And, lo and behold, polygyny is even more common than monogamy, while
polyandry
is found in perhaps two cultures (one in Tibet and the other in
Africa),
and in both it involves brothers "sharing" a wife in order not to
break-up
tiny inherited properties..
</p>
<p>Taking it from the other direction, males will tolerate less
infidelity
than females:&nbsp; Females "know" their children are theirs; males
never
know for sure.&nbsp; Genetically, it matters less if males "sow wild
oats"
or have many mates or are unfaithful.&nbsp; And, sure enough, most
cultures
are harder on women than men when it comes to adultery.&nbsp; In most
cultures,
in fact, it is the woman who moves into the husband's family
(virilocality)
-- as if to keep track of her comings and goings.
</p>
<p>From our culture's romantic view of love and marriage, it is
interesting
to note that in most cultures a failure to consummate a marriage is
grounds
for divorce or annulment.&nbsp; In our own culture, infertility and
impotence
are frequent causes of divorce.&nbsp; It seems reproduction is more
important
than we like to admit.
</p>
<p>Of course, there is a limit to the extent to which we generalize
from
animals to humans (or from any species to any other), and this is
especially
true regarding sex.&nbsp; We are very sexy animals:&nbsp; Most animals
restrict their sexual activity to narrowly defined periods of time,
while
we have sex all month and all year round.&nbsp; We can only guess how
we
got to be this way.&nbsp; Perhaps it has to do with the long-term
helplessness
of our infants.&nbsp; What better way to keep a family together than to
make it so very reinforcing!
</p>
<p><b>Children</b>
</p>
<p>That brings us to children, our attraction to them, and their
attraction
to us.&nbsp; Adults of many species, including ours, seem to find small
representatives of their species, with short arms and legs, large
heads,
flat faces, and big, round eyes... "cute" somehow -- "sweet," the
sociobiologist
might point out.&nbsp; It does make considerable evolutionary sense
that,
in animals with relatively helpless young, the adults should be
attracted
to their infants.
</p>
<p>The infants, in turn, seem to be attracted to certain things as
well.&nbsp;
Goslings, as everyone knows, become attached to the first large moving
object they come across in the first two days of life -- usually mother
goose (occasionally Konrad Lorenz or other ethologists).&nbsp; This is
called <b>imprinting</b>.&nbsp; Human infants respond to pairs of

eyes,
female voices, and touch.
</p>
<p>The goslings&nbsp; respond&nbsp; to their sign-stimulus with <b>the
following response</b>,&nbsp; literally following that large moving
object.&nbsp;
Human infants, of course, are incapable of following, so they resort to
subterfuge:&nbsp; the broad, full bodied, toothless smile&nbsp; which
parents
find overwhelmingly attractive.
</p>
<p>Sociobiologists go on to predict that mothers will care for their
children
more than fathers (they have more invested in them, and are more
certain
of their maternity); that older mothers will care more than younger
mothers
(they have fewer chances of further procreation); that we will be more
solicitous of our children when we have few (or only one!) than when we
have many; that we will increase our concern for our children as they
get
older (they have demonstrated their survival potential); and that we
will
tend to push our children into marriage and children of their own.
</p>
<p><b>Helping</b>
</p>
<p>Care -- helping behavior -- is likely when it involves our children,
parents, spouses, or other close relations.&nbsp; It is less and less
likely
when it involves cousins or unrelated neighbors.&nbsp; It is so unusual
when it involves strangers or distant people of other cultures and
races
that we recall one story -- the good Samaritan -- nearly 2000 years
after
the fact.
</p>
<p>Sociobiologists predict that helping decreases with kinship
distance.&nbsp;
In fact, it should occur only when the sacrifice you make is outweighed
by the advantage that sacrifice provides the genes you share with those
relations.&nbsp; The geneticist J. B. S. Haldane supposedly once put it
this way:&nbsp; "I'd gladly give my life for three of my brothers, five
of my nephews, nine of my cousins...."&nbsp; This is called <b>kin
selection</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Altruism based on genetic selfishness!
</p>
<p>One kind of "altruistic" behavior is <b>herd behavior</b>.&nbsp;
Some animals just seem to want to be close, and in dangerous times
closer
still.&nbsp; It makes sense:&nbsp; By collecting in a herd, you are
less
likely to be attacked by a predator.&nbsp; Mind you, sometimes you may
find yourself on the outside of the herd -- but the odds are good that
the next time you'll be snugly inside.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>Another kind is called <b>reciprocal
altruism</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A prairy dog who sees a predator will begin
to yelp loudly, for example.&nbsp; This warns the rest of his
community, although it draws the predators attention to the one doing
the yelping!<br>
</p>
<p>Herd behavior and reciprocal altruism work for the same reason that
kin selection works:&nbsp; It caters to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">inclusive fitness</span>:&nbsp; A slight
reduction of my own survival probabiliities is more than balanced by
the survival of relatively close relations.&nbsp; Some animals even
help any member of their on
species,
with the instinctual "understanding" that they may be the beneficiaries
the next time they need help themselves.
</p>
<p>Robert Trivers has suggested that people engage in a more
sophisticated
form of reciprocal altruism, shared only with a few of the more
advanced
creatures of the world.&nbsp; Here you would be willing to sacrifice
for
someone else if it is understood that that specific other will do the
same
for you, or reciprocate in some other way, "tit for tat." Clearly, this
requires the ability to recognize individuals and to recall debts!
</p>
<p>Other geneticists have pointed out that, if there is a genetic basis
for reciprocal altruism, their will also be some individuals that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cheat</span>
by allowing others to do for them without ever meeting their own
obligations.&nbsp;
In fact, depending on the advantages that reciprocal altruism provides
and the tendency of altruists to get back at cheaters, cheaters will be
found in any population.&nbsp; Other studies have shown that
"sociopathy,"
guiltless ignoring of social norms, is found in a sizable portion of
the
human population.
</p>
<p>There is, of course, no need for a human being to be 100% altruist
or
100% cheat.&nbsp; Most of us (or is it all of us?), although we get
angry
at cheats, are quite capable of cheating when the occasion
arises.&nbsp;
We feel guilt, of course, be we can cheat.&nbsp; A large portion of the
human psyche seems to be devoted to calculating our chances of success
or failure at such shady maneuvers.&nbsp; More on this later.
</p>
<p><b>Aggression</b>
</p>
<p>Like many concepts in social psychology, aggression has many
definitions,
even many evaluations.&nbsp; Some think of aggression as a great virtue
(e.g. "the aggressive businessperson"), while others see aggression as
symptomatic of mental illness.
</p>
<p>The fact they we do keep the same word anyway suggests that there is
a commonality:&nbsp; Both positive and negative aggression serve to
enhance
the self.&nbsp; The positive version, which we could call
assertiveness,
is acting in a way that enhances the self, without the implication that
we are hurting someone else.&nbsp; The negative version, which we might
call violence, focuses more on the "disenhancement" of others as a
means
to the same end.
</p>
<p>Although the life of animals often seems rather bloody, we must take
care not to confuse <b>predation</b> -- the hunting and killing of
other
animals for food -- with aggression.&nbsp; Predation in carnivorous
species
has more in common with grazing in vegetarian species than with
aggression
between members of the same species.&nbsp; Take a good look at your
neighborhood
cat hunting a mouse:&nbsp; He is cool, composed, not hot and
crazed.&nbsp;
In human terms, there is not the usual emotional correlate of
aggression:&nbsp;
anger.&nbsp; He is simply taking care of business.
</p>
<p>That taken care of, there remains remarkably little aggression in
the
animal world.&nbsp; But it does remain.&nbsp; We find it most often in
circumstances of <b>competition</b>&nbsp; over a resource.&nbsp; This
resource
must be important for "fitness," that is, relevant to one's individual
or reproductive success.&nbsp; Further, it must be restricted in
abundance:&nbsp;
Animals do not, for example, compete for air, but may for water, food,
nesting areas, and mates.
</p>
<p>It is the last item -- mates -- that accounts for most aggression in
mammals.&nbsp; And it is males that are most noted for this
aggression.&nbsp;
As we mentioned earlier, females have so much at stake in any act of
copulation
-- so many months gestation, the increased energy requirement,
susceptibility
to attack, the dangers of birth, the responsibility of lactation --
that
it serves their fitness to be "picky" when looking for a partner.&nbsp;
If females are picky, males must be show-offs:&nbsp; The male must
demonstrate
that he has the qualities that serve the female's fitness, in order to
serve his own fitness.&nbsp; Deer are a good example.&nbsp; Mind you,
this
need not be conscious or learned; in all likelihood, it is all quite
instinctual
in most mammals.&nbsp; It may possibly have some instinctual bases in
us
as well.
</p>
<p>Some of his aggressiveness may in fact be mediated by <b>testosterone</b>,&nbsp;
the "male" hormone.&nbsp; Inject testosterone into female mice and
their
threshold for aggressive behavior goes down.&nbsp; Remove testosterone
from male mice (by castrating the poor things) and their thresholds go
up.&nbsp; But I must add that testosterone does not cause aggression,
it
just lowers the threshold for it.
</p>
<p>But females in many species can be quite aggressive (such as female
guinea pigs), and females in any species can be extremely aggressive in
certain circumstances (such as when facing a threat to her
infants).&nbsp;
In human societies, the sociological statistics are clear:&nbsp; Most
violent
crime is committed by men.&nbsp; But we have already noticed that, as
women
assert their rights to full participation in the social and economic
world,
those statistics are changing.&nbsp; Time will tell the degree to which
testosterone is responsible for aggression in people.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, males engage in a great deal of head-butting.&nbsp;
But
one can't help but notice that these contests "over" females seldom end
in death or even serious injury in most species.&nbsp; That is because
these contests are just that:&nbsp; contests.&nbsp; They are a matter
of
<b>displays</b>
of virtues, and they usually include actions that serve as sign stimuli
to the opponent that the contest has ended in his favor: <b>surrender
signals</b>.&nbsp;
Continued aggression is of little advantage to either the loser or the
winner.&nbsp; Even male rattlesnakes don't bite each other!
</p>
<p><b>Territoriality</b> and <b>dominance hierarchies</b> -- once
thought
to be major focuses of aggressive behavior -- seem to be relatively
less
significant.&nbsp; Animals tend to respect territorial and status
claims
more than dispute them.&nbsp; It is only when circumstances, whether
natural
or humanly created, are out of the ordinary that we see much
aggression.&nbsp;
And low food supplies likely have little to do with aggression.&nbsp;
Southwick,
studying Rhesus monkeys in the London Zoo, found that reducing the food
supplies by 25% had no effect on the amount of aggression found, and
reducing
the food supplies by 50% actually decreased aggression!&nbsp; We find
the
same thing among primitive people.
</p>
<p><b>Aggression in Human Beings</b>
</p>
<p>So why so much aggression in people?&nbsp; One possibility is our
lack
of biological&nbsp; restraints.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sociobiologists predict
that
animals that are poorly equipt for aggression are unlikely to have
developed
surrender signals.&nbsp; Man, they say, is one of these
creatures.&nbsp;
But we developed <b>technology</b>, including a technology of
destruction,
and this technology "evolved" much too quickly for our biological
evolution
to provide us with compensating restraints on aggression.&nbsp;
Experience
tells us that guns are more dangerous than knives, though both are
efficient
killing machines, because a gun is faster and provides us with less
time
to consider our act rationally -- the only restraint left us.
</p>
<p>Another problem is that we humans live not just in the "real" world,
but in a <b>symbolic</b> world as well.&nbsp; A lion gets aggressive
about
something here-and-now.&nbsp; People get aggressive about things that
happened
long ago, things that they think will happen some day in the future, or
things that they've been told is happening.&nbsp; Likewise, a lion gets
angry about pretty physical things.&nbsp; Calling him a name won't
bother
him a bit.
</p>
<p>A lion gets angry about something that happens to him
personally.&nbsp;
We get angry about things that happen to our cars, our houses, our
communities,
our nations, our religious establishments, and so on.&nbsp; We have
extended
our "ego's" way beyond our selves and our loved ones to all sorts of
symbolic
things.&nbsp; The response to flag burning is only the latest example.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;If aggression has an instinctual basis in human beings, we
would
expect there to be a sign stimulus.&nbsp; It would certainly not be
something
as simple as bright red males during mating season, as in stickleback
fish.&nbsp;
If we go back to the idea of competition as a fertile ground for
aggression,
we notice that <b>frustration</b> is a likely candidate.&nbsp; There
are
two of you who want the same thing; if one grabs it, the other doesn't
get it and is unhappy; so he takes it, and now the other is unhappy;
and
so on.&nbsp; Goal-directed behavior has been blocked, and that is
frustration.
</p>
<p>Variations on that theme abound:&nbsp; We can be frustrated when an
on-going behavior is interrupted (trying tripping someone); we can be
frustrated
by a delay of goal achievement (cut in front of someone on line at the
supermarket); or we can be frustrated by the disruption of ordinary
behavior
patterns (cause me to forego my morning coffee).&nbsp; We are flexible
creatures.
</p>
<p>But we must beware here:&nbsp; Other things can lead to aggression
besides
frustration (or aren't highly paid boxers engaged in aggression?) and
frustration
can lead to other things besides aggression (or doesn't social
impotence
lead to depression?).&nbsp; Further, as Fromm points out, frustration
(and
aggression) is in the eyes of the beholder.&nbsp; He feels that the
frustration
must be experienced as unjust or as a sign of rejection for it to lead
to aggression.

<p><b>Sociobiology "versus" Culture</b>
</p>
<p>Many psychologists, sociologist, anthropologists, and others are
wary
of the explanations -- convincing though they sometimes are -- of the
sociobiologists:&nbsp;
For every sociobiological explanation, we can find a cultural
explanation
as well.&nbsp; After all, culture operates by the same principles as
evolution.
</p>
<p>There are many different ways to do any one task, but in the context
of a certain physical environment and a certain culture, some ways of
doing
things work better than others.&nbsp; These are more likely to be
"passed
on" from one generation to the next, this time by learning.
</p>
<p>Now, cultures need to accomplish certain things if they are to
survive
at all.&nbsp; They must assure effective use of natural resources, for
example, which might involve the learning of all sorts of territorial
and
aggressive behaviors, just like in sociobiological explanations.&nbsp;
And they must assure a degree of cooperation, which might involve
learning
altruistic behaviors, rules for sharing resources and for other social
relationships, just like the ones in sociobiological
explanations.&nbsp;
And they must assure a continuation of the population, which might
involve
certain courtship and marital arrangements, nurturant behaviors, and so
on, just like in sociobiological explanations.
</p>
<p>If a society is to survive -- and any existing society has at least

survived until now -- it must take care of the very same issues that
genetics
must take care of.&nbsp; And, because learning is considerably more
flexible
than evolutionary adaptation, we would expect culture to tend to
replace
genetics.&nbsp; That is, after all, only evolutionary good sense!
</p>
<p>So do we have instincts?&nbsp; If&nbsp; instincts are defined as
automatic
reflex-like connections -- no, probably not.&nbsp; But define instincts
as "strong innate tendencies toward certain behaviors in certain
situations"&nbsp;
--&nbsp; yes, we probably do.&nbsp;&nbsp; The important point is that
we
(unlike animals) can always say&nbsp; no&nbsp; to our instinctual
behaviors,
just like we can say no to our learned ones!
