        <i>STATIC ELECTRICITY: <strong>Static electricity</strong>&nbsp;is an imbalance of&nbsp;<strong>electric</strong>&nbsp;charges within or on the surface of a material or electricity at rest.</i> Static Electricity is electricity but its characteristics  create
          problems which cost industry billions of dollars per year. A clearer
          understanding of static electricity and electrostatics can be gained by explaining lightning. Static electricity
          in the atmosphere is in an unbalanced state remains at that way  until the potential gradient, between
          clouds, reaches a level that causes the insulator between clouds, in
          this case air, to break down or fail. Lightning is created to equalize
          the potential gradient. For the brief instant the lightning flashes,
        the static electricity becomes the more familiar electricity is no longer at rest.&nbsp;
        <p>&nbsp;What do we know about this phenomenon called "static electricity" or &quot;electrostatics&quot; or &quot;static shock&quot;?
          What is static electricity  and how do we remove static electricity  or at least control / reduce static electricity? The information below will help you to understand static electricity and to control the costs associated with it.</p>
        <hr width="70%">
        <p><a name="cause"></a><b><a href="https://electrostatics.com/products.html">CAUSE</a></b> <br>
          Static electricity is generated by an unbalance of the molecular construction
            of relatively non-conductive insulators such as plastics, paper, glass, ceramics and other non conductive materials.
            All matter is composed of atoms. A balanced atom contains positive
            charges that are present in the nucleus of the atom. An equal amount
            of negative charges orbits this nucleus in the form of electrons.
            Both charges are equal and, therefore, the overall charge of a balanced
            atom is zero. However, should this configuration be disturbed and
            several electrons removed from this atom, we end up with a greater
            positive charge in the nucleus and a deficiency of electrons, which
            gives you an overall charge in the positive direction. Conversely,
            should we add a few extra electrons, we have an overall charge of
            negative, due to the fact that we now have an excess of electrons
            and the net charge is now in the negative direction. See<i> figure
            below.</i> <br>

          <p><img src="Electro1.gif" alt="static control what is static electricity" width="393" height="157" > </p>
          <p align="left">Some materials such as glass, hair, and Nylon tend
            to give up electrons and become positively charged.&nbsp; Other materials
            such as Polypropylene, Vinyl (PVC), Silicon, Teflon, Silicone tend
            to collect electrons and become negatively charged. The Triboelectric
            series is a listing of various materials and there tendency to charge
            positive or negative.</p>

        <p><a name="conduct"></a><b><a href="https://electrostatics.com/products.html">CONDUCTIVITY</a></b> </p>
        <p align="left"> The ability of material to surrender its electrons or
          absorb excess electrons is purely a function of the conductivity of
          the material with which you are working. For example, a pure conductor,
          such as copper, has a rigid molecular construction that will not permit
          its electrons to be moved about freely. However, as you approach the
          semi-conductor range, such as some bond papers, the ability of this
          material to surrender its electrons is relatively easy and can be accomplished
          by friction, heat or pressure. As you approach the purely non-conductive
          materials, such as plastics, glass ceramics, it is extremely easy to disrupt the molecular
          construction and cause the material to charge with the slightest friction,
          heat or pressure. If the conductivity of your processed material can
          be controlled, then, preventing static electricity becomes relatively
          easy.&nbsp; However if the material is nonconductive static electricity can build up on the material.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;For example, adding surface conductivity to plastics will move
          them up into the higher conductivity range and prevent the build up
          of static electricity that is caused by friction. This is normally
          accomplished by use of additives such as moisture and anti-static sprays.
          The average anti-static spray is made up from a soap based material
          that's been diluted in a solvent, such as mild alcohol. A fire retardant
          is added to combat flammability of the solvent. A short time after
          contact with your material, the fire retardant and solvents evaporate
          leaving you with a conductive coating on the surface of the material.
          The plastic has now become conductive and as long as this coating is
          not disturbed, it will be difficult to generate static electricity
          in this material.&nbsp; </p>

        <h2 align="center" class="style1"><a href="https://electrostatics.com/staticmeter.html">Active
          Solutions to Reduce or <br>
          Eliminate Static Electricity </a></h2>
        <p><a name="ioniz"></a><b><a href="https://electrostatics.com/products.html">IONIZATION</a></b></p>
        <p align="left"> By following the above steps, you can reduce
          the hazards of building up high charges of static electricity to a point.
          However the above steps are passive and of limited effectiveness.
          Also changing a specified material or adding a spray may not be possible or allowed. An active method static control is by ionization. It is important
          to understand that static electricity cannot be entirely eliminated.
          In fact, the terminology, "static eliminators," is definitely
          misleading.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Static eliminators are really ionizing units that produce
          both positive and negative ions to be attracted by the unbalanced
          material so that neutralization does occur. For example, a
          charged piece of material can be neutralized by utilizing a
          static neutralizer. However, it does not eliminate the static
          electricity because, if the material is again frictioned after
          being neutralized, static electricity will be generated.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;In order to gain the most benefit from your static neutralizing
          or static control equipment, it is important that you understand how they operate
          and how they provide the means of neutralization. Most <a href="https://electrostatics.com/products.html">electronic
            static neutralizers</a> are constructed by placing a high voltage
          on a sharp point in close proximity to a grounded shield or
          casing. There are two basic types static control ionizers-
          AC &amp; DC. </p>
        <p>With Alternating Current ionizers the high voltage alternates
          current pulses through the 60 cycle operation, the air between
          the sharp points and the grounded casing is actually broken
          down by ionization and therefore both positive and negative
          ions are being generated. Half of the cycle is utilized to
          generate negative ions and the other half is utilized to generate
          positive ions. On 50 or 60 cycles per second power grid polarity
          is changing ionization every 1/100 or 1/120 of a second.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>DC ionizers also put a high voltage on a sharp point but need
          to produce the opposite polarity by a second power supply or
          some kind of circuitry to switch polarity. </p>
        <p>Both AC and DC Systems have advantages. The application, cost,
          performance, space are all factored into deciding the proper
          type of static control ionizer to use.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;If the material being neutralized is charged positive,
          it will immediately absorb negative ions from the static neutralizer
          and repel the positive ions. When the material becomes neutralized,
          there is no longer electrostatic attraction and the material
          will cease to absorb ions. Conversely, if the material being
          neutralized is charged negative, it will absorb the positive
          ions being generated by the neutralizer and repel the negative
          ions. Again, once neutralization is accomplished, the material
          will no longer attract ions. <i>See figure below.</i></p>

        </p>
        <p>Nuclear-powered equipment may also be used to generate ionized
          air for static neutralization. These devices, powered by Polonium
          210 isotopes which have a half-life of only 138 days, are continually
          losing their strength and must be replaced annually. They are
          more expensive and less effective than electrically powered
          devices. These nuclear devices cannot be purchased and are
          leased by users. One year lease costs are usually more than
          the purchase price of comparable electrically powered devices.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>&nbsp; <a name="problem"></a></p>
        <p><b>PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION</b> <br>
          Before any problem can be solved it must be identified. Is your problem
          related to static electricity? An in-depth analysis should be made
          with the <a href="https://electrostatics.com/products.html">necessary
            equipment</a> and <a href="https://electrostatics.com/page3.html">experience</a> to

        <p align="center" class="style1">Passive Solutions </p>
        <p><b><a href="https://electrostatics.com/products.html">INDUCTION</a><a name="induct"></a>&nbsp;</b> <br>
          Removing or neutralizing static electricity by induction is the simplest
            and oldest method. Tinsel or special wire are the most common tools for this application.
            However, tinsel is oftentimes misused, get dirt and damaged and, therefore, oftentimes
            not successful. The first thing that must be recognized is the fact
            that any induction device, such as tinsel, will never reduce or neutralize
            static electricity to the zero potential level. This is due to the
            fact that a threshold or beginning voltage is required to "start" the
            process and that voltage is high.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;First, the correct induction equipment must be utilized. The
          induction bar must be well grounded electrically. The induction bar
          must be stretched tight and placed 1/4 of an inch from the material
          to be neutralized. There must be "free air space" under the material
          to be neutralized directly under or over the spot where you place the
          tinsel. In this fashion the induction will reduce static electricity
          on both sides of the static laden material.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;Actually, if the above steps are utilized, the sharp ends or
          points of the grounded induction device will ionize the air over the
          surface being neutralized, because the grounded sharp ends are placed
          within the electrostatic field that is present due to static electricity.
          If the static charge is negative in polarity, the electrostatic field
          is negative and positive ions are generated via the grounded sharp
          ends of the induction device and the positive ions are attracted back
          to the static laden surface. Conversely, if the static charge is positive
          in polarity, negative ions will be generated by the grounding induction
          device and attracted back to the charged area.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Induction does work but is limited to reducing the level of static
          to a threshold level which usually still very high and usually higher than what is needed to reduce or eliminate problems related to static electricity. <a href="#ioniz">Ionization
          or active static control</a> is the best way to reduce static charge
          on non conductive surfaces to very low levels. </p>

        <a name="ground"></a><b><a href="https://electrostatics.com/products.html">GROUNDING</a></b> <br>
        It is also possible to disturb the molecular construction of your operator.
        As ridiculous as this sounds, if an operator is isolated by standing
        on a wooden floor or wearing crepe rubber soles, he will soon pick up
        a voltage gradient. For example, it is possible for an operator to charge
        to several hundred volts each time he handles a piece of charged plastic.
        As he handles many different pieces, he will become charged to a higher
        voltage gradient until a flash-over will occur and the operator receives
        a shock, and or damages a static sensitive device. This can be prevented
        by having your operator stand on a grounded conductive mat, by the use
        of personnel grounding equipment that is commercially available and by
        ionization.&nbsp; <a href="https://electrostatics.com/esd.htm">Read more
        about ESD static control, </a>
                <p>&nbsp;Personnel grounding equipment becomes important if your
                  operators are sitting while working. This is the best means
                  of isolating operators and, therefore, they become extremely
                  vulnerable to static discharge due to charging. This phenomenon
                  can be related to an individual dragging his feet on the living
                  room rug and then discharging himself by touching a well grounded
                  lamp.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>&nbsp;In addition, grounding of all your plant machinery and
                  related equipment is most important. It never ceases to amaze
                  us that so many plants are operating machinery that is not
                  grounded electrically. Besides the safety factor, a grounded
                  machine will help drain off extremely high charges of static
                  electricity from partial conductors. Remember, grounding is
                  only an aid to reducing your problems with static electricity.
                  It is not a solution.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>&nbsp;For example, grounding your operators will not drain
                  off static electricity from their clothing. Also, it will not
                  drain off static electricity from a plastic container one maybe
                  holding. The conductivity of some clothing and most plastics
                  is so low that electricity cannot flow to a ground; hence, "static
                  electricity." To solve this problem, ionization or active static
                  control must be utilized.&nbsp;</p>
