Sociobiology (of which evolutionary psychology is a subfield that particularly concerns humans) can be thought of as having, like any <b><a href=metatheory/lakatos.html>research program</a></b>, a "hard core" of problem solving strategies that provide <i>possible</i> answers to vexing research questions, and a "protective belt" of promising research questions to be addressed by providing <i>actual</i> answers to these questions.  The protective belt <i>structures our ignorance</i> by identifying research questions that must be addressed if the research program is to advance.  Whereas the actual answers that arise from the protective belt may be wrong, the hard core (by methodological fiat) is never wrong--any potential negative evidence is to be blamed on faulty auxiliary assumptions rather than on the theory itself.<p>	Sociobiology can be thought of as a special case of the <a href=evolutionary/adaptationist.html><b>adaptationist program</b></a>, which assumes that all phenotypic features (or characters) of contemporary organisms result from the fact that these features allowed the organisms' predecessors to produce more offspring in a prehistoric environment (Lewontin, 1979).  "Narrow sociobiology" is defined as the study of evolution and of function, and chiefly applies to non-human animals in which cultural transmission is not an important variable intervening between possible and actual explanations (Kitcher, 1988).  The hard core of narrow sociobiology includes the following laws or problem solving strategies, the basics of evolutionary theory:<ul>    <li>descent with modification (Darwin),<br>     <li><a href=evolutionary/inclusive.html><b>inclusive fitness</b></a> (Hamilton),<br>    <li>game theory (Maynard Smith),<br>    <li>optimization theory (Trivers).<p></ul>"Pop sociobiology" (represented by Wilson, 1975, 1978) comprises narrow sociobiology plus some additional machinary that allows one to go from evolutionary theory to "human nature" (Kitcher, 1987).  The argument that allows one to progress from a behavior's maximizing fitness to a proscription on efforts to change the behavior through social engineering is called <b><a href=evolutionary/ladder.html>Wilson's ladder</a></b> (Kitcher, 1987).<p>  Levels 1 and 2 of Wilson's ladder together comprise the <a href=evolutionary/adaptationist.html><b>adaptationist program</b></a> that Lewontin (1979) considers illegitimate, even in narrow sociobiology.  According to the adaptationist program, natural selection generates optimal phenotypes.  It is hard to find an interpretation of the adaptationist program (i.e., an argument for optimality) that is both nontrivial and true.  The slogan "survival of the fittest" is not true, for, as Kitcher (1987) argues, "There may be no optimal phenotype, or the optimal phenotype may be coded by a heterozygote, or, if there are more than two alleles at a locus, the fitness relations among the genotypes may prevent the fixation of the fittest" (p. 66).  Moreover, selection is not the only evolutionary force--there is also chance, the effects of which can be both large and permanent in small populations.  In view of these considerations, a panglossian interpretation of the effects of natural selection ("we live in the best of all possible worlds") would be mistaken.<p>Most sociobiologists are genetic determinists, though some are more subtle than others.  There are three waystations along the high road to <a href=evolutionary/determinism.html><b>genetic determinism</b></a>:  the doctrine of genetic fixity, the doctrine of innate capacity, and the doctrine of statistical variation.  Each doctrine is more sophisticated than its predecessor (Lewontin, 1991).<p>Evolutionary ideas have been applied to human social relationships in a number of areas.  Chief among these are mate selection and <a href=evolutionary/aggression.html><b>aggression</b></a>.</blockquote><h5><i>~ <a href=#top>Flip to top</a> ~</h5></i>&nbsp;<br><hr><p><a name=references><blockquote><center><h2>References</h2></center>Kitcher, P.
