<p>You should seek out help by reaching out to your professor, TA's, and other tutoring resources such as the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/slc" rel="nofollow"><span>Sanger Learning Center</span></a>. If you feel that you cannot make the grade necessary for your degree, you should schedule an appointment with your academic advisor by calling 471-4509 to get the necessary forms for a Q-drop in the course. The Q-drop deadline is 2/3rds of the way through the semester so you should check the <a href="http://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars" rel="nofollow"><span>Registrar's calendar</span></a> to be aware of this deadline and give yourself adequate time to get the signatures necessary on your form before that date. If you are experiencing difficulty due to non-academic reasons, you should make an appointment to visit the CNS non-academic counselors by visiting WCH 1.106 or calling 471-4536. Non-academic Q-drops that are approved by non-academic counselors do not count against your Q-drop limit. </p>

<p>Yes, you can use a One-Time-Exception Q-drop once in your undergraduate career. This drop counts as one of your 6 allotted Q-drops. You can find more information about the OTE drop on the <span><a href="https://www.cns.utexas.edu/advising/guidelines-procedures" rel="nofollow">CNS website</a></span>. You can pick up the form in the Dean’s office in WCH 1.106 or in the CS Advising Center. The form is due by the last class day of the semester.

<p>You should not take a course pass/fail if you need that class to fulfill a degree requirement. Courses taken pass/fail count towards your total number of residence hours and elective hours, but nothing else. They do not count towards your GPA (unless an F is earned) and do not fulfill prerequisite requirements. This means you should NOT take any CS courses as pass/fail unless you are using them for only elective requirements. Only electives should be taken pass/fail, unless you plan on repeating the course later for a letter grade. College of Natural Sciences students may only count 16 pass/fail hours toward their degree (All BA Degree and B S/BSA degrees prior to 14 -16 catalog) , and may only take two courses pass/fail per semester. You may not take a class pass/fail unless you have 30 hours completed. You may select this option when you register for the course, or you may go by the CS Advising Center in GDC 2.702 or the CNS Dean's Office in WCH 1.106 <em>by the Q-drop deadline </em>to change your grading to pass/fail.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333; font-size:12px">For the 2014-16 catalog, College of Natural Sciences BA students may only count 16 pass/fail hours toward their degree, and may only take two courses pass/fail per semester.  BSA and BS students may only count 6 pass/fail hours toward their degree, and may only take two courses pass/fail per semester.</span></p>
<p>If you earn a 60 or better in a pass/fail class, you will receive a CR on your transcript. This will not factor into your GPA. If you earn less than a 60, you will receive an F on your transcript and this will count as a 0.0 factored into your GPA.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Withdrawal from The University is done after a student has completed  registration for a semester or summer session, and then decides not to  attend <strong><em>any</em></strong> classes that semester or session.</p>
<p>The registration system will not permit you to withdraw by yourself.  You must do this in the CNS Dean’s Office. If it is not possible to come  to the office, please call (512) 471-4536. During the first four weeks  of class there is a pro-rated refund for withdrawing from school. A full  refund, less $15.00, is ONLY given if a student withdraws prior to the  first day of class. Failure to properly withdraw results in failing  grades in all semester coursework. Leaving UT without a formal  withdrawal is the same as failing all classes and has the same  consequences.</p>
<p>After the final deadline, students may not drop or withdraw unless  there are serious non-academic circumstances, which occurred after the Q  deadline date. Appeals will only be considered for documented,  non-academic reasons. Contact the CNS Dean’s Office, WCH 1.106,  (512)  471-4536 for non-academic issues. <em>You must include your EID in all communication, by phone, voicemail, or email, for our office to assist you.</em></p>

<p>The College of Natural Sciences uses the <a href="http://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars" rel="nofollow"><span>UT calendar</span></a> for purposes of registration, adding and dropping courses, and withdrawing from the university.</p>
<p>The general schedule for each semester is as follows:</p>
<p>* Class days 1 – 4, add via the <a href="http://registrar.utexas.edu/services" rel="nofollow"><span>online Registration system</span></a><br /> * Class days 5 – 12, advisors may add students within the departmental classes (at their discretion)<br /> * Class days 1 – 12, drop via the <a href="http://registrar.utexas.edu/services" rel="nofollow"><span>online Registration system</span></a><br /> * Class day 13 on, adds or drops can be initiated in the CNS Dean's office (WCH 1.106); classes dropped after the 12th class day show up on your record as a Q-drop (a drop without refund or penalty). You are allotted 6 Q-drops in your entire undergraduate career.</p>
<p>If you drop a class up to the 12th class day, you will receive a tuition refund, if necessary, and classes do not appear on the permanent record. Not attending does not automatically drop you from classes or withdraw you from UT; you need to do that yourself. <em>Always double-check your final schedule before the 12th class day.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Important dates for Fall 2014</em>:<br /></strong>August 25: Add-drops for students who have registered and paid their tuition<br /> August 27: Classes begin<br /> September 2: last day to add-drop classes on your own through the registration system online<br /> September 12: Last date to drop a class for a possible refund and without a Q<br />November 4: Q-drop deadline - last day for students to drop a class with a Q on their record, last day to apply to graduate or walk in May ceremony<br />Oct 27 - Nov 7: Registration for Spring 2015 semester</p>

<p><strong>Here are some important things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>1. You must have an extenuating circumstance to appeal. For example - a medical issue or something similar that had a negative impact on your GPA. This issue will need to be documented by a physician or a nonacademic counselor. </p>

<p>If you wish to change majors out of Computer Science and into another major within the College of Natural Sciences, set up an appointment with an advisor for the major you wish to declare. Any CNS student who has completed more than 45 semester hours of college credit must have a university grade point average of at least 2.00 to be eligible for transfer to another college or school within The UT.</p>
<p>To change into another college, you should look at the website and follow the specific instructions, or contact the dean's office of the college into which you wish to be admitted. Some colleges (including Business, Communications, and Engineering) require new students to attend an internal transfer information meeting before they can speak to an advisor.</p>
<p>You can find more information about majors offered and internal transfer requirements on the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/wayfinder/explore/major" rel="nofollow"><span>UGS Wayfinder website</span></a>. If you think you want to change majors but aren't sure to what, make an appointment to meet with an advisor in by the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc" rel="nofollow"><span>Center for Strategic Advising </span></a>in Jester A115. </p>

<div>  <div class="">
      
  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>The CS department install of <strong>procmail</strong> which filters your mail upon delivery is specially configured for our environment. It is set up as usual via your <em>~/.procmailrc</em> file, but with two caveats:</p>
<ol><li>You may not run a program from your .procmailrc. This is to protect  our mailserver (and thus your mailbox), not only from deliberately  malicious actions but also from accidental misconfigurations which would  swamp the server. Since our mail server does not allow user logins for  the same reasons, this is an extension of existing policy.</li>
<li>You may not forward mail to another user via the '!' mechanism in a  procmail recipe. This is to protect the mail server from the high load  and eventual meltdown that can be caused by a mail loop. </li>
</ol><p>With these restrictions in mind, the main use of procmail during  message delivery at CS is to filter your mail in real-time into  different folders based on headers (such as the score it received from  our spam-analysis system, the sender, a mailing-list-specific header, or  the subject).</p>
<p>Since we have disabled execute and forward functionality in procmail  during delivery, we suggest using the example in the procmail(1) man  page for a template in creating your own post-processing scripts. The  version of procmail in /lusr/bin which you can run manually does not  suffer these limitations.</p>
<p>(Search for the third occurrence of the string 'cron' in this man page to find the example script.)</p>
<p>Two changes you will need to make to that script are to change the <em>$ORGMAIL</em> variable to point to the actual location of the folder, and to provide a  separate procmail recipe file to the executed version of procmail in  the script (the line <em>formail -s procmail &lt; .newmail &amp;&amp;</em> will need to be changed to  <em>formail -s procmail /path/to/your/recipefile &lt; .newmail &amp;&amp;</em> ).</p>
<p>These scripts can be run periodically via the <strong>cron(1)</strong> command to do the actions automatically, or you can run them before you  read mail to do something like filter out the messages or text you  don't like.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: To avoid clobbering mail folders make sure all recipes start with :0:, not just :0. The procmailrc(1) and procmail(1) manpages have more details."</p>

<li>You can use a third party webmail system, such as Outlook.com, GMail or Yahoo.  Specific instructions for setting this up will vary by webmail provider so it's beyond our ability to support, but googling for "other" "email" "account" and the name of the provider should get you pointed in the right direction.  Note that many of these only allow POP access to your CS email account, so if you plan to still use other email software to access your CS email, choose the settings in your webmail provider's configuration carefully (leave email on server, in particular).</li>

    <a href="/faq/68637">Is there some way to have a cgi script run on the CS webserver as my own UID rather than the one belonging to the webserver software? </a>  </h3>
<div>  <div class="">
      
  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>By default, CGI scripts running on our server execute as the web user www; this user has no special permissions. Thus, the directory in which the script resides must be world-searchable, the script must be world-executable, and files read or written by the script must be world-readable or world-writable.</p>
<p>In certain applications, you may prefer that a script execute with your Unix account permissions so as to access protected data. We provide a <em>"Secure CGI"</em> mechanism for doing this.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Please carefully weigh your need for this feature against the security risks of a script running with the full permissions of your user account. You are responsible for the use of that account, whether by your own hand, by someone using a workstation where you left yourself logged in, or by someone exploiting a poorly written script which you have made available on the Web. You may wish to <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/policies/" rel="nofollow"> review our policies</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The basic guidelines for setting up a secure CGI script are: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Full script pathnames should contain only printing ASCII characters. They should not contain relative path components.</li>
<li>Script directories should be searchable by the owner and have the same owner/group as the script file. They should not be writable by anyone other than the owner</li>
<li>Script files should be a regular file (not a symlink), be executable by the owner and have the extension ".scgi".They should not be setuid or setgid or writable by anyone other than the owner.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Other notes: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Non-parsed-header scripts may be used with the usual nph- prefix.</li>
<li>Access control directives (in a .htaccess file) will not work for a .scgi script. Normally, this is not a problem, since the script is typically the action associated with a form in a .html file, which <em>can</em> be access controlled. Of course, the script is at liberty to implement any authentication for itself that it chooses.</li>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>This is a tough question; there is definitely some content such as sounds and images which will never be universally available to blind or deaf users. However for the most part, staying standards compliant and making sure that your pages have no syntax errors or dependency on a specific browser is the best way to be sure of reaching the widest possible audience.</p>
<p>The canonical reference for the most popular and most widely supported markup languages, HTML and XHTML, is <a href="http://www.w3.org" rel="nofollow">published by the World Wide Web Consortium</a>. This documentation is the agreed-upon standard for web markup across the entire internet. It is likely to be supported by all browsers, from cell phones and text-only browsers for the blind to the latest version of Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>To be sure you've created pages that not only meet the standards but fail to have any content-impairing typos, you should probably run them through the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" rel="nofollow">XHTML and HTML validator</a> and potentially through the <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" rel="nofollow">CSS validator</a> as well, if you have used cascading style sheets for further page layout. Be warned that older or less capable browsers may not support CSS so do try reading your page without the CSS in the source to see if all text displays fully and legibly in its absence.</p>
<p>Although it is popular to write browser-specific code targetting IE or mozilla/netscape, and although such code may work on the majority of the browsers available today, you do limit your site's usefulness by doing so. Consider whether you think the cute tricks with the cursor or ActiveX controls are worth someone not being able to find the link to your resume or research. Old, small, and handicapped accessible browsers may be unable to use your site and often will just ignore it instead of informing you. <a href="http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/" rel="nofollow">The "Viewable With Any Browser" campaign</a> may serve to further enlighten you as to the rationale behind creating more compatible web pages.

    <a href="/faq/69811">What type of computer should I buy?</a>  </h3>
<div>  <div class="">
      
  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>We get this question often from prospective students, so we asked our ambassadors, experienced CS students to answer:</p>
<p> "As far as computers go, every CS student has access to the computers in the 3rd floor and basement labs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex for their programming and general purpose needs as well as the computers around campus in the libraries and other computer labs for general purpose use. The computer labs in Gates are open 24/7 for student use. Therefore, the type of computer that you should buy in preparation for coming to college should be one that you are comfortable using. There is no departmental preference between Windows, Mac, Unix, or Chrome operating systems. In terms of hardware, few classes will actually stress your computer to the point where processors overheating becomes an issue and for CS classes that require a lot of computing power for simulations or graphics, most students use the computers in the labs. Most computer science classes do not allow students to take notes on laptops during class, so laptop use in class would likely only be for non-CS courses and would probably consist of note taking.  [For example, a student recalls using a laptop with a processor that was 2 or 3 steps behind the i3 as well as one with an i3 processor and had no laptop related problems.]</p>
<p>While having a laptop in college is not a requirement, I definitely recommend that students bring one just in case they need to use a computer while in their dorm room. As for the type of computer, the best, short answer that I can give is for you to bring the laptop that you are most comfortable using, because you won't have to do anything on your personal computer remotely that you wouldn't be able to do on a lab computer (besides take notes in class). It is definitely common for students to have basic laptops for general purpose use. For example, a student might primarily use their laptop for note taking and occasionally remote accessing to one of the CS machines at UT to do programming. If a student requires the use of a certain software or needs to be on the network (and etc), they typically choose to work in the labs. There are students who have more advanced laptops and even desktops, but it's definitely not required and most people use these more advanced systems for personal use such as gaming, not because it's a requirement of the major. This is why we suggest prospective students to buy whatever laptop they feel comfortable working on and has the capability to do what they would want to do outside of class." </p>

<p>Successful applicants to the PhD program for fall semesters will be considered for doctoral fellowships during the application process. Exceptional incoming computer scientists in the graduate program are candidates for the prestigious Provost’s Graduate Excellence Fellowship, offering four years of fellowship support. In addition to the doctoral fellowships, teaching assistantships and graduate research assistantships may be offered to PhD students for up to five academic years. Most PhD students obtain a graduate research assistantship by the second or third year of the program, working under a research supervisor. Please see the <a href="https://login.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/financial-information">financial information page</a> for more information about funding available for students in the PhD program.</p>
<p>We do not offer financial assistance with admission to the master's program. Teaching and research positions are sometimes available; however, students who apply to the master's program should be prepared to finance their study here. A summer internship between years is often available through one of the companies who are <a href="https://login.cs.utexas.edu/industry/focs/partners">Friends of Computer Science (FoCS)</a>. These internships help our master's students fund their study and provide valuable professional experience.</p>

<p>The Graduate School requires applicants to have earned a bachelor’s degree from a <a href="https://gradschool.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/Regional%20Accrediting%20Organizations.pdf">regionally accredited institution</a> in the United States or a <a href="https://gradschool.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/161213_Comparable_Degrees.docx">comparable degree</a> from a foreign academic institution.</p>
<p>For admission to the UT Computer Science graduate program, a previous CS degree is helpful but not required.</p>
<p><strong>Upper-division GPA of 3.0 or higher</strong></p>
<p>A grade-point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) or a comparable GPA in upper-division work—junior- and senior-level courses—and in any graduate work already completed is required.</p>
<p>Applicants admitted to the UT Computer Science graduate program usually have shown their skills in CS by achieving a better than average GPA in their CS courses.</p>
<p><strong>Official Test Scores (GRE, TOEFL/IELTS)</strong></p>
<ul><li> <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre">GRE General Test </a>scores*
<ul><li>There is no minimum GRE test score, however applicants admitted to the UT Computer Science graduate program usually have high quantitative GRE scores and a math background that includes study through some discrete math.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl/">TOEFL</a> or <a href="http://www.ielts.org/">IELTS</a> score for international applicants*
<ul><li>The minimum scores considered acceptable for admission by the Graduate School are:
<ul><li>TOEFL: 79 on the Internet-based test (iBT)</li>
<li>IELTS: An overall band of 6.5 on the Academic Examination</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><em>*We cannot waive the GRE requirement for applicants with work experience or advanced degrees. These scores are an important part of our evaluation.</em></p>
<p><em>*International applicants who are from <a href="http://admissions.utexas.edu/apply/qualifying-countries">a country where English is the only official language</a> are exempt from this requirement. Additionally, applicants are exempt from the requirement if they possess a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. institution or an institution in a country where English is the only official language. <strong>The requirement is not waived for applicants who have earned a master’s—but not a bachelor’s—degree from a similar institution.</strong></em></p>

<div>  <div class="">
      
  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>While not required, a previous CS bachelor’s degree is strongly recommended since admission is very competitive. Successful applicants usually have an undergraduate degree in CS or a closely related area such as Electrical and Computer Engineering. Use of computers at work or some experience programming are not considered to be equivalent to a CS degree and courses.</p>
<p>For students who do not possess a bachelor's degree in CS, the following UTCS undergraduate courses, or equivalent, are required as background for our graduate degrees. They are not prerequisites for admission, however, and can be satisfied after admission to the program.</p>
<p>Discrete Math for Computer Science (CS 311)<br />
Introduction to Programming (CS 312)<br />
Data Structures (CS 314)<br />
Algorithms and Complexity (CS 331)<br />
Computer Organization and Architecture (CS 429)<br />
Principles of Computer Systems (CS 439)</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/academics/curriculum/courses">undergraduate course descriptions</a> for more information about the material covered in these courses. For prospective students who are seeking to enhance their application by completing background courses prior to applying, we recommend enrolling in a similar course at your local university. Online coursework is generally not considered sufficient to clear the background requirement.</p>
