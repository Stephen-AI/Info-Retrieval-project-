    <p>Hi, I'm Bennett Ramirez, class of 2021.</p>
    <p>You will find that this section of the Internet is completely devoid of content. That is because I am far too busy to edit it to make it look nice, so unfortunately, there is not much to see here.</p>
    <p>Maybe my <a href="https://github.com/oldmud0">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/oldmud0">GitLab</a> profile will be more interesting to you.</p>
    <p>Anyway, nice to meet you!</p>
