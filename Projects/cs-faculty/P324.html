        The ability for human designers to foresee uncertainties for robots, and write software programs accordingly, is severely limited by their mental simulation capabilities. This predictive approach of robot programing grows quickly in complexity and often fails to handle the infinite possibilities represented by the physical world. As a result, robots today are task-specific or “rigid”; i.e., having difficulty at handling tasks or conditions that were not planned for. During this talk, the speaker will present the vision of “soft autonomy” in making future robots adaptive, flexible, and resilient. He will draw lessons from over a decade of UAV flight testing research and the development of a sample return robot that won NASA’s Centennial challenge, and identify several research directions in making future robots more intelligent.

        Peer review is the backbone of scholarly research. It is however faced with a number of challenges (or demons) such as subjectivity, bias/miscalibration, noise, and strategic behavior. The growing number of submissions in many areas of research such as machine learning has significantly increased the scale of these demons. This talk will present some principled and practical approaches to battle these demons in peer review: (1) Subjectivity: How to ensure that all papers are judged by the same yardstick? (2) Bias/miscalibration: How to use ratings in presence of arbitrary or adversarial miscalibration? (3) Noise: How to assign reviewers to papers to simultaneously ensure fair and accurate evaluations in the presence of review noise? (4) Strategic behavior: How to insulate peer review from strategic behavior of author-reviewers? The work uses tools from social choice theory, statistics and learning theory, information theory, game theory and decision theory. (No prior knowledge on these topics will be assumed.)

        In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL) such as healthcare, dialogue systems and robotics, running a new policy on humans or robots can be costly or risky.  This gives rise to the critical need for off-policy estimation, that is, estimate the average reward of a target policy given data that was previously collected by another policy.  In this talk, we will review some of the key techniques, such as inverse propensity score and doubly robust methods, as well as a few important applications.  We will then describe a recent work that for the first time makes off-policy estimation practical for long- or even infinite-horizon RL problems.  (Joint work with Qiang Liu, Ziyang Tang, Denny Zhou and many others.)

                </h4>
        Reinforcement learning and symbolic planning have both been used to build intelligent autonomous agents. Reinforcement learning relies on learning from interactions with real world, which often requires an unfeasibly large amount of experience, while deep reinforcement learning approaches are criticized for lack of interpretability. Symbolic planning relies on manually crafted symbolic knowledge, which may not be robust to domain uncertainties and changes. In this talk I explore several ways to integrate symbolic planning with hierarchical reinforcement learning to cope with decision-making in a dynamic environment with uncertainties. Symbolic plans are used to guide the agent's task execution and learning, and the learned experience is fed back to symbolic knowledge to improve planning. This method is evaluated in benchmark reinforcement learning problems, leading to data-efficient policy search and robust symbolic plans in complex domains and improve task-level interpretability.

        Statistical Relational AI (StaRAI) Models combine the powerful formalisms of probability theory and first-order logic to handle uncertainty in large, complex problems. While they provide a very effective representation paradigm due to their succinctness and parameter sharing, efficient learning is a significant problem in these models. First, I will discuss state-of-the-art learning methods based on boosting that is representation independent. Our results demonstrate that learning multiple weak models can lead to a dramatic improvement in accuracy and efficiency. One of the key attractive properties of StaRAI models is that they use a rich representation for modeling the domain that potentially allows for seam-less human interaction. However, in current StaRAI research, the human is restricted to either being a mere labeler or being an oracle who provides the entire model. I will present the recent progress that allows for more reasonable human interaction where the human input is taken as “advice” and the learning algorithm combines this advice with data. Finally, I will discuss more recent work on soliciting advice from humans as needed that allows for seamless interactions with the human expert.

        Code generation from natural language is the task of generating
programs written in a programming language (e.g. Python) given a
command in natural language (e.g. English). For example, if the input
is "sort list x in reverse order", then the system would be required
to output "x.sort(reverse=True)" in Python. In this talk, I will talk
about (1) machine learning models to perform this code generation, (2)
methods for mining data from programming web sites such as stack
overflow, and (3) methods for semi-supervised learning, that allow the
model to learn from either English or Python on its own, without the
corresponding parallel data.

        Recent technological developments are creating new spatio-temporal data streams that contain a wealth of information relevant to sustainable development goals. Modern AI techniques have the potential to yield accurate, inexpensive, and highly scalable models to inform research and policy. A key challenge, however, is the lack of large quantities of labeled data that often characterize successful machine learning applications. In this talk, I will present new approaches for learning useful spatio-temporal models in contexts where labeled training data is scarce or not available at all. I will show applications to predict and map poverty in developing countries, monitor  agricultural productivity and food security outcomes, and map infrastructure access in Africa. Our methods can reliably predict economic well-being using only high-resolution satellite imagery. Because images are passively collected in every corner of the world, our methods can provide timely and accurate measurements in a very scalable end economic way. Finally, I will disucss opportunities and challenges for using these predictions to support decision making, including technqiques calibration and for inferring human preferences from data.

        Probabilistic graphical models are a powerful tool for representing systems with complex interdependence and uncertainty.  Flexible languages such as probabilistic logic have made these models easier to express and more accessible to non-experts.  However, exact inference is intractable, and while approximate methods can be effective in practice it is often difficult to know what method will be effective or have confidence in the quality of their results.  I will describe a framework that combines strengths from the three major approximation paradigms (variational bounds, search, and sampling) to provide guaranteed confidence intervals and smoothly trade off computational effort with their quality.  The resulting algorithms give fast and accurate results for a wide variety of models by automatically adapting to the properties of a given problem instance.

        In healthcare, a tsunami of medical data has emerged, including electronic health records, images, literature, etc. These data can be heterogeneous and noisy, which renders clinical decision-making time-consuming, error-prone and suboptimal. In this thesis, we develop machine learning (ML) models and systems for distilling high-value patterns from unstructured clinical data and making informed and real-time medical predictions and recommendations, to aid physicians in improving the efficiency of workflow and quality of patient care. When developing these models, we encounter several challenges: (1) How to better capture infrequent clinical patterns, such as rare subtypes of diseases; (2) How to make the models generalize well on unseen patients? (3) How to promote the interpretability of the decisions? (4) How to improve the timeliness of decision-making without sacrificing its quality? (5) How to efficiently discover massive clinical patterns from large-scale data? To address challenges (1-4), we systematically study diversity-promoting learning, which encourages the components in ML models (1) to diversely spread out to give infrequent patterns a broader coverage, (2) to be imposed with structured constraints for better generalization performance, (3) to be mutually complementary for more compact representation of information, and (4) to be less redundant for better interpretation. The study is performed in the context of both frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics. In the former, we develop diversity-promoting regularizers that are empirically effective, theoretically analyzable and computationally efficient. In the latter, we develop Bayesian priors that effectively entail an inductive bias of "diversity" among a finite or infinite number of components and facilitate the development of efficient posterior inference algorithms. To address challenge (5), we study large-scale learning. Specifically, we design efficient distributed ML systems by exploiting a system-algorithm co-design approach. Inspired by a sufficient factor property of many ML models, we design a peer-to-peer system -- Orpheus -- that significantly reduces communication and fault tolerance costs. We apply the proposed diversity-promoting learning (DPL) techniques and distributed ML systems to address several critical issues in healthcare, including discharge medication prediction, automatic ICD code filling, automatic generalization of medical-imaging reports, similar-patient retrieval, hierarchical multi-label tagging of medical images, and large-scale medical-topic discovery. Evaluations on various clinical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the DPL methods and efficiency of the Orpheus system.

some of them are still living in a simulated world, using simulated
data such as  Facebook bAbI.  In this talk, we emphasize that dialog
research needs to be grounded with the real need of users.  We
introduce three user-centered task-oriented dialog systems utilized
reinforcement learning. The first system is a dialog systems that
utilized reinforcement learning to interleave social conversation and
task conversation to promote movies more effectively. The second
system is a sentiment adaptive bus information search system. It uses
sentiment as immediate reward to help the end-to-end RL dialog
framework to converge faster and better. The trained dialog policy
will also have a user friendly effect. It would adapt to user’s
sentiment when choosing dialog action templates. For example, the
policy will pick template that provides more detailed instructions
when user is being negative. This is extremely useful for customer
service dialog systems where users frequently get angry. The third
system is a task-oriented visual dialog systems. It uses a
hierarchical reinforcement learning to track multimZodal dialog states
and decide among sub tasks of whether to ask more information or just
give an answer. Such system can complete the task more successfully
and effectively. We are conducting a further experiment to deploy the
system as a shopping assistant.

        We present new algorithms for computing and approximating bisimulation metrics in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Bisimulation metrics are an elegant formalism that capture behavioral equivalence between states and provide strong theoretical guarantees. Unfortunately, their computation is expensive and requires a tabular representation of the states, which has thus far rendered them impractical for large problems. In this paper we present two new algorithms for approximating bisimulation metrics in large, deterministic MDPs. The first does so via sampling and is guaranteed to converge to the true metric. The second is a differentiable loss which allows us to learn an approximation even for continuous state MDPs, which prior to this work has not been possible.

This talk covers my experiences in learning how to teach these skills, and what I've learned from direct interactions with my students and from various studies I've run in the lab and with live search traffic.  I'll discuss my MOOC (PowerSearchingWithGoogle.com), which has had over 4M students, my live classes, and various publications in paper, book, and video formats.

        Markov random fields provide a unified framework to represent probability distributions that factorize over a given graph.  As inference in these models is often intractable, approximate methods such as belief propagation (BP) are often used in practice.  However, theoretically characterizing the quality of the BP approximation has proved challenging.  Recent work has demonstrated that these types of approximations can yield provable lower bounds on a variety of combinatorial counting problems including the matrix permanent and the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model.  I’ll describe the known results and a new conjectured lower bound on the number of graph homomorphisms from a bipartite graph G into an arbitrary graph H.

        Reinforcement Learning presents a challenging problem: agents must generalize experiences, efficiently explore their world, and learn from feedback that is sparse and delayed, all under a limited computational budget. Abstraction can help make each of these endeavors more tractable. Through abstraction, agents form concise models of both their surroundings and behavior, enabling effective decision making in diverse and complex environments. In this talk I explore abstraction's role in reinforcement learning, with a focus on state abstraction. I present classes of state abstractions that can (1) preserve near-optimal behavior, (2) be transferred across similar tasks, and (3) induce a trade-off between performance and learning or planning time. Collectively, these results provide a partial path toward abstractions that minimize the complexity of decision making while retaining near-optimality.
