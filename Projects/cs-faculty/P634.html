<h2>About Me</h2>
Nice to meet you. I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin
studying computer science in the Turing Scholars program (class of 2021).
I work with Professor
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/">Işıl Dillig</a> as a member of
the <a href="http://utopia.cs.utexas.edu/">UToPiA research group</a>.

Ignite was created during the 2017 EGaDS Game Jam, with a theme of “trash”.
I worked as director and lead developer of a team of 5.

<p>
Image Manipulation was the first project in CS 314H,
Data Structures and Algorithms. We implemented a variety of image filters
and were encouraged to create our own afterwards.

<p>
Random Writer was the second project in CS 314H.
We implemented random text generation using Markov chains.
As a bonus assignment, I extended this to work with music and images.
