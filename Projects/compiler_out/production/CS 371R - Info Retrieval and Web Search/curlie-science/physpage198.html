<A NAME="WHAT"><H2>
<LI> What is a Dyson Sphere?</H2></A>

The Dyson sphere (or Dyson shell) was originally proposed in 1959 
by the astronomer Freeman Dyson in "Search for Artificial Stellar 
Sources of Infrared Radiation" in <I>Science</I> as a way for an 
advanced civilisation to utilise all of the energy radiated by their 
sun. It is an artificial sphere the size of an planetary orbit. The 
sphere would consist of a shell of solar collectors or habitats around 
the star, so that all (or at least a significant amount) energy will hit 
a receiving surface where it can be used. This would create a huge 
living space and gather enormous amounts of energy.
 <P>
A Dyson sphere in the solar system, with a radius of one AU would 
have a surface area of <I>at least</I> 2.72e17 km^2, around 600 
million times the surface area of the Earth. The sun has a energy 
output of around 4e26 W, of which most would be available to 
do useful work.
 <P>
The original proposal simply assumed there would be enough solar 
collectors around the star to absorb the starlight, not that they 
would form a continuous shell. Rather, the shell would consist of 
independently orbiting structures, around a million kilometres 
thick and containing more than 1e5 objects. But various science 
fiction authors seem to have misinterpreted the concept to mean a 
solid shell enclosing the star, usually having an inhabitable surface 
on the inside, and this idea was so compelling that it has been the 
main use of the term in science fiction. The earliest appearance of 
this version seems to be Robert Silverberg's novel <I>Across a Billion 
Years</I>.  
 <P>
A third kind of shell would be very thin and non-rotating, held up
by the radiation pressure of the sun. It would consist of statites (see below,
in the section about stability). Essentially it is a "dyson bubble", where reflecting sails reflect light onto collectors for use in external habitats. 
Its mass would be very smalll, on the order of a small moon or large asteroid.

 <P>
In the following I will call solid Dyson spheres Type II or dyson 
shells and independently orbiting spheres Type I.

<A NAME="WHO"><H2>
<LI> Who is Freeman Dyson?</H2></A>

Freeman Dyson was born in 1923 in Crowthorne, Berkshire, England. 
Dyson received his bachelor of arts degree in mathematics from the 
University of Cambridge in 1945. He completed fellowships at Cambridge's
Trinity College from 1946 to 1947, at Cornell University in 1947 and at 
the University of Birmingham from 1949 to 1951. He returned to Cornell 
to become a professor of physics in 1951, leaving in 1953 to join the 
Institute for Advanced Study, where he is now professor emeritus.
 <P>
Dyson is a fellow of the Royal Society, a member of the U.S. National 
Academy of Sciences, a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of 
Sciences, a honorary fellow of Trinity College and an Associé Etranger 
de l'Académie des Sciences. He is president of the the

SSI (Space Studies Institute)</A>. 
 <P>
Among his numerous awards and honors, Dyson received the Oersted Medal 
from the American Association of Physics Teachers, the Phi Beta Kappa 
Award in Science for <I>Infinite in All Directions</I>, the National 
Books Critics Circle Award for nonfiction, the 1981 Wolf Prize in physics, 
the <A HREF="http://www.rockefeller.edu/pubinfo/dyson.nr.html">Lewis Thomas Prize</A> and many other honors.

<A NAME="FIRST"><H2>
<LI> Was Dyson First?</H2></A>


No, he admitted himself that his original inspiration came from 
<I>The Star Maker</I> by <A HREF="http://euro.net/mark-space/bioOlafStapledon.html">Olaf Stapledon</A>, written in 1937. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As the aeons advanced, hundreds of thousands of worldlets were constructed, all of this type, but gradually increasing in size and complexity. Many a star without natural planets came to be surrounded by concentric rings of artificial worlds. In some cases the inner rings contained scores, the outer rings thousands of globes adapted to life at some particular distance from the sun. Great diversity, both physical and mental, would distinguish worlds even of the same ring.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Stapledon, in turn, may have got the idea from J. D. Bernal, who also influenced
Dyson directly. Bernal describes
in <A HREF="http://www.hia.com/hia/pcr/bernal.html">The World, the Flesh, and the Devil</A> spherical space colonies:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

       Imagine a spherical shell ten miles or so in diameter, made of the lightest materials and mostly hollow;
       for this purpose the new molecular materials would be admirably suited. Owing to the absence of
       gravitation its construction would not be an engineering feat of any magnitude. The source of the
       material out of which this would be made would only be in small part drawn from the earth; for the
       great bulk of the structure would be made out of the substance of one or more smaller asteroids, rings of
       Saturn or other planetary detritus. The initial stages of construction are the most difficult to imagine.
       They will probably consist of attaching an asteroid of some hundred yards or so diameter to a space
       vessel, hollowing it out and using the removed material to build the first protective shell. Afterwards the
       shell could be re-worked, bit by bit, using elaborated and more suitable substances and at the same
       time increasing its size by diminishing its thickness. The globe would fulfil all the functions by which our
       earth manages to support life. In default of a gravitational field it has, perforce, to keep its atmosphere
       and the greater portion of its life inside; but as all its nourishment comes in the form of energy through its
       outer surface it would be forced to resemble on the whole an enormously complicated single-celled
       plant.

 <P>
       A star is essentially an immense reservoir of energy which is being dissipated as rapidly as its bulk will
       allow. It may be that, in the future, man will have no use for energy and be indifferent to stars except as
       spectacles, but if (and this seems more probable) energy is still needed, the stars cannot be allowed to
       continue to in their old way, but will be turned into efficient heat engines. The second law of
       thermodynamics, as Jeans delights in pointing out to us, will ultimately bring this universe to an
       inglorious close, may perhaps always remain the final factor. But by intelligent organization the life of
       the universe could probably be prolonged to many millions of millions of times what it would be
       without organization. Besides, we are still too close to the birth of the universe to be certain about its
       death. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>


According to Stefan E. Jones &lt;stefanj@io.com&gt;;, Raymond Z. Gallun, an american 
SF author may have come up with a similar concept independently.



<A NAME="WHY"><H2>
<LI> Why build a Dyson sphere?</H2></A>

Energy and space. As described above, the amount of collected 
energy would be immense, and the living space simply 
unimaginable. Dyson pointed out that so far the energy usage of 
mankind has increased exponentially for at least a couple of 
thousand years, and if this continues we will soon consume more 
energy than the Earth receives from the sun, so the natural step is 
to build artificial habitats around the sun so that all energy can be 
used. The same goes for population in the long run (it should be 
noted that this is not a solution, just a logical result of growth). It is 
also possible that the Dyson sphere simply stores the energy for 
future use, for example in the form of antimatter. 
 <P>
Even if cheap and efficient fusion power can be developed, 
eventually the waste heat has to be radiated away by a Dyson sphere-like
cooling system. 
 <P>
Other proposed uses have been for security (although it is hard to 
hide the infrared emissions; energy could be radiated away in 
certain directions, but thermodynamics places some limits on it), or 
just for the fun of it (if you have a sufficiently advanced technology 
megaengineering could become a hobby activity; after all, ordinary 
people today perform engineering or crafting feats far beyond the 
imagination of previous eras). 

<A NAME="LOOK"><H2>
<LI> What would a Dyson Sphere look like from the outside?</H2></A>


A Type I Dyson sphere would probably not cover the star perfectly, 
so occasional glimpses of its surface would be seen as the habitats 
orbited. A type II Dyson sphere would be totally opaque (unless it 
had openings). The spheres would hence be invisible from a 
distance, just a black disk on the sky. But they would shine 
powerfully in the infrared, as the waste heat from the internal 
processes radiate away. The apparent temperature would be

<BLOCKQUOTE>
T = (E / (4 pi r^2 eta sigma))^1/4
</BLOCKQUOTE>

where E is the energy output of the sun, r the radius of the
sphere, eta the emissivity and sigma the constant of Stefan-Boltzman's
law. 
 <P>
This would correspond to an infrared wavelength of lambda = 
2.8978e-3 / T m (assuming a blackbody sphere) which for 
reasonable sizes lies in the infrared. 
Dyson predicted the peak of the radiation at ten micrometers.

<A NAME="LOOK_IN"><H2>
<LI> What would a Dyson Sphere look like from the inside?</H2></A>

The curvature of the "ground" would be even less than on Earth, so 
to an observer close to it it would look perfectly flat.
In a solid dyson sphere with atmosphere, the atmosphere would limit
the range of sight due to its opacity, and the horizon would be slightly
misty.
 <P>
The sky would be filled with the surface of the sphere, giving the 
impression of a huge bowl over a flat earth, covered with clouds,
continents and oceans although for a real Dyson shell these would have
to be immense to be noticeable. The angular size of an object at a distance
d and diameter l is 2arctan(l/2d). For an object of diameter 10,000 km
(like the Earth) at a distance of a 100 million km (around 120 degrees 
away from the observer on the shell), the angular size would be around 
10^-4 rad or 0.005 degrees, roughly the size of a pea 100 meters away. 
 <P>
It should be noted (as Richard Treitel has pointed out) that even a
very dark surface will shine intensely, making the sky much brighter than
on Earth. The albedo of Earth is around 0.37, so an interior with an
earthlike environment would have a sky where each patch reflects a 
noticeable fraction of the sunlight.  
 <P>
In a type I dyson sphere roughly the same things would be seen: a plane wall 
of orbital habitats, solar collectors and whatnot stretching away into what
 looks like infinity (although here the curvature may become noticeable for
 observant viewers) and a hemispherical bowl covering the rest of the sky,
 centered around the sun. Solar collectors would have a very low albedo, but
 it is still likely that the interior will be very bright.

<A NAME="STABLE"><H2>
<LI> Is a Dyson sphere stable?</H2></A>


In a type I Dyson Sphere all the structures orbit independently 
around the star, and their orbits are normal keplerian elliptic or 
circular orbits. Since the mass of the shell is negligible compared to 
the sun, the self-gravity can be ignored (it will merely cause some 
precession of elliptical orbits). And if two orbits intersect, they can 
be adjusted by using solar sails, ion engines, magsails or similar 
low-energy devices.
 <P>
Another version would be based on statites (this is probably due to 
Robert L. Forward): each solar collector will also be a solar sail, and 
hover without orbiting above the sun, held up by light pressure. By 
adjusting the sail area statites can move in and out, and by 
adjusting their angle they can move away if needed. Traffic control 
may be a problem, but can likely be handled in various ways, for 
example by local flight control centres or automatic systems based 
on flocking behaviour. 
 <P>
The force on a statite would be F = L/(4 pi c r^2) - GMm/r^2, where L is the total luminosity of the sun (3.9e26 W), M is the mass of the sun, m is the density of the statite, r the distance to the sun
and c is the speed of light. 
To remain in 
balance, the statite will have to have the density

<BLOCKQUOTE>
m=E/(4 pi c G M)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

(this assumes a 100% reflective statite). Note that this is independent of
distance to the sun, closer to the sun the gravitational pull is greater,
but the radiation pressure is stronger. The density depends only on the
mass/luminosity of the sun. 
For a statite in the solar system, the density would be around 0.78 g/m^2

 <P>
A rigid dyson sphere is not stable, since there is no net attraction 
between a spherical shell and a point mass inside. If the shell is 
pushed slightly, for example by a meteor hit, the shell will 
gradually drift off and eventually hit the star. This is a classic 
problem in elementary mechanics and is usually solved in 
introductory textbooks. 
 <P>

<H3>Gauss Law</H3>

One easy way to derive it is from Gauss Law: the integral of the 
force across an arbitrary closed surface is proportional to the 
amount of mass inside it. If the surface is a sphere surrounding the 
dyson sphere, there is obviously an inward force on the surface of 
the sphere since there is a mass inside it. But if the sphere is inside 
the dyson sphere (the sun is ignored in this calculation, as we are 
only interested in the gravity of the dyson sphere), there is no mass 
inside it and hence the integral must be zero, which means that 
there is no gravitational field inside the sphere. 

<H3>Elementary Proof</H3>

It can also be proven using only elementary (brute force) calculus. 
This treatment is from Kleppner & Kolenkow, <I>An Introduction to 
Mechanics</I>  (p. 101) and deals with the force between a point of 
mass m at radius r on the x-axis from a spherical shell centred at 
the origin:
 <P>
Divide the shell into narrow rings. Let R be the radius of the shell, t 
its thickness (t << R). The ring at angle theta, which subtends an 
angle dtheta, has a circumference 2 pi R sin theta, width R dtheta 
an thickness t, which gives it a volume of 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
dV=2 pi R^2 t sin theta d theta
</BLOCKQUOTE>

and a mass of (M/2) sin theta dtheta where rho is the density of 
the shell. 
 <P>
Each part of the ring is the same distance r´ from m, and by 
symmetry the force from the ring is directed along the axis with no 
transversal component. Since the angle alpha between the force 
vector and the line of centres is the same for all sections of the ring, 
the force components along the line of centres add to give

<BLOCKQUOTE>
dF=G m rho dV cos alpha / r´^2
</BLOCKQUOTE>

for the whole ring. This is then integrated: F = int (G m rho dV/r´2) 
cos alpha. By expressing cos alpha as a function of polar angle we 
get:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
F = [GMm/2] int_0^pi ( (r - R cos theta) sin theta dtheta)/(r^2 + R^2 -
 2 r R cos theta)^2/3
</BLOCKQUOTE>

(where int_0^pi is the integral from 0 to pi).
Through the substitution u=r-Rcos(theta), du=Rsin theta dtheta we 
get:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
F = [GMm/2R] int_{r-R}^{r+R} (u du) / (R^2 - r^2 +2ru)^(3/2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

which is a standard integral resulting in:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
F = (GMm/2R)(1/2r^2)[sqrt(R^2-r^2+2ru)-(r^2-R^2)/sqrt(R^2-
r^2+2ru)]_{r-R}^{r+R}
</BLOCKQUOTE>

For r&lt;R we get:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
F=(GMm/4Rr^2){(R+r)-(R-r)-(r^2-R^2)(1/(R+r)-1/(R-r))} = 0
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<A NAME="STRENGTH">

 <H2>
<LI> How strong does a rigid Dyson shell need to be?</H2></A>

Very strong. According to Frank Palmer:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Any sphere about a gravitating body can be analysed into two
hemispheres joined at a seam.  The contribution of a small section
To the force on the seam is
<BLOCKQUOTE>
g(ravity)*d(ensity)*t(hickness)*A(rea)*cos(angle).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
    The integral of A*cos(angle) is (pi)*R^2. <P>
    So the total force is g*d*t*(pi)*R^2.  Which is
independent of distance, neatly enough. <P>
    The area resisting the force is 2*(pi)*R*t. <P>
    Thus, the pressure is g*d*R/2;  this can be translated
into a cylindrical tower of a given height on Earth.  If that
tower built of that material can stand, then the compression
strain is not too great.
 <P> 
    At 1 AU, that comes to 2*([pi]*AU/YR)^2, or -- by my
calculations -- in the neighborhood of 80 to 90 THOUSAND
kilometers high.
  <P>
    The tendncy to buckle, moreover, is another problem.

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<A NAME="GRAV"><H2>
<LI> What about gravity on a rigid Dyson shell?</H2></A>

A nonrotating dyson shell would have just two sources of gravity: 
the shell itself and the star. As mentioned above, on the inside only 
the gravity of the star would be felt and everything would fall 
down into it, while on the outside there would be weak gravity (for 
a 1 AU sphere centred around the sun, the gravity would be 6e-3 m/s^2). 
 <P>
The only ways to make a rigid Dyson shell habitable on 
the inside would be either to provide it with some sort of 
antigravity (which is unlikely) or to rotate it, which would make 
only the equatorial band habitable unless the interior was terraced. 
A rotating dyson sphere would be under immense strains; see the 
section about the ringworld for a simple calculation. Niven pointed 
out that if you want to spin a Dyson sphere, it is better to build it 
like a film canister for reasons of structural strength, and then you 
have a Ringworld. 
 <P>
It has been suggested that one could live on the outside of the
sphere, especially if the interior star is rather cool; it appears that
a terrestrial environment is possible around M stars just at the end
of the main sequence. <A HREF="http://www.alcyone.com/max/writing/essays/outside-dyson.html">Erik Max Francis gives the following derivation
of this kind of sphere</A>:
 <P>
First, know the luminosity-mass relation for main sequence stars:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    L = k M^nu, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

where k is a constant of proportionality and nu is between 3.5 and 4.0.
(k depends on the choice of nu, obviously.)  You can find the constant k, given nu,
based on the fact that the Sun has a luminosity of 3.83 x 10^26 W and a mass of
1.99 x 10^30 kg.
 <P>
Second, know the gravitational acceleration:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    g = G M/R^2.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


Third, the blackbody power law (we're approximating the star as a blackbody, which
isn't too bad of an approximation):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    L = e sigma A T^4.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Knowing these factors, you can combine them to get an equation which relates the
mass of the star to the desired temperature and gravity of the sphere:

 <BLOCKQUOTE>
   k M^(nu - 1) = 4 pi e sigma G T^4/g.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


Substituting ideal conditions (g = 9.81 m/s^2, T = 300 K), you find that M must be
between 0.054 and 0.079 masses solar (the variance is dependent on the variance in
the exponent in the mass-luminosity relation).  The end of the main sequence is at
about 0.08 masses solar, for comparison.
 <P>
This would produce spheres with a radius of 0.0057-0.0069 AU (852,720 - 1,032,240 km). 

 <P>

It might also be possible to have a biosphere
between two dyson spheres (this is used in Baxter's <I>The Time Ships</I>).



<A NAME="WIND"><H2>
<LI> Would the solar wind be a problem?</H2></A>

If an earthlike ecology was built inside a large rigid dyson shell, 
there would be an influx of ions (mostly hydrogen) from the solar wind. 
The solar 
wind has a density of around 5 ions/cm^3, moving at around 500 
km/s; that would lead to an influx of 2.5e12 ions/m^2/s. This 
might appear large, but is actually a tiny amount, just 4e-12 mol 
(one gram of hydrogen is approximately one mol). Since the 
hydrogen could not naturally escape from the atmosphere it would 
gradually become more and more hydrogen rich, but it would take 
trillions of years before the effects became significant. The net force 
from the solar wind and the light pressure (which is larger than
the solar wind pressure)
is also minor compared to the attraction of the sun and the internal 
strains of a rotating dyson shell. In a type I dyson sphere the light 
pressure could be used to keep statites hanging in space.
 <P>
It should be noted that there would be no auroras in a dyson shell, 
since there is no magnetic field. This also would also mean that 
more radiation would reach the ground from the sun since it cannot 
naturally be deflected (although one could imagine 
megaengineering systems to provide an artificial magnetic field).

<A NAME="BUILT"><H2>
<LI> Can a Dyson sphere be built using realistic technology?</H2></A>


A type I Dyson sphere can be built gradually, without any 
supertechnology or supermaterials, just the long-term deployment 
of more solar collectors and habitats. This work could start today 
(and one might argue that our satellites are the first step). Using 
self-replicating machinery the asteroid belt and minor moons could 
be converted into habitats in a few years, while disassembly of 
larger planets would take 10-1000 times longer (depending on how 
much energy and violence was used).
 <P>
A rigid dyson shell would require superstrong materials, and its 
construction is complicated since half a shell is unstable. One could 
conceive of some dramatic capping process, where a number of 
previously freely orbiting structural components at the same time 
moved inwards to lock together into a shell (for example twenty 
spherical triangles). This would require tremendous precision, but 
since supertechnology is already assumed for building a rigid shell, 
it seems almost trivial. As somebody put it, if you can build a dyson 
shell you don't need it.


<A NAME="ENOUGH"><H2>
<LI> Is there enough matter in the solar system to build a Dyson shell?</H2></A>


Dyson originally calculated that there is enough matter in the solar 
system to create a shell at least three meters thick, but this might 
be an overestimate since most matter in the solar system is 
hydrogen and helium, which isn't usable as building materials (as 
far as we know today). They could presumably be fusioned into 
heavier elements, but if you can fusion elements on that scale, why 
bother with a dyson sphere?
 <P>
If one assumes that all elements heavier than helium are usable (a 
slight exaggeration), then the inner planets are completely usable, 
as is the asteroid belt.

</PRE>

It is a bit more uncertain how much of the outer planets is usable.
Jupiter and Saturn mainly consist of hydrogen and helium, with around
0.1% of other material. Jupiter is assumed to have a rock core massing
around 10-15 times the Earth, and Saturn probably contains a smaller core
massing around 3 times the Earth. Uranus and Neptunus seem to be mainly rock and ice,
with around 15% hydrogen, so a rough estimate would be around 50-70% usable
mass. Pluto seems to be around 80% usable.

 <P>
(these tables based on information from <I>Physics and Chemistry of 
the Solar System</I> by John S. Lewis and <A HREF="http://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/">The Nine Planets</A> by  Bill Arnett)
 <P>
The inner system contains enough usable material for a 
dyson sphere. If one assumes a 1 AU radius, there will be around 
42 kg/m^2 of the sphere. This is probably far too 
little to build a massive type II dyson sphere, but probably enough 
to build a type I dyson sphere where mass is concentrated into 
habitats and most of the surface is solar sails and receivers, which 
can presumably be made quite thin. 
 <P>
With the extra material from the outer system, we get around 600 kg/m^2,
which is enough for a quite heavy sphere (if it was all iron, it would be 
around 8 centimeters thick, and if it was all diamond around 20 centimeters). 
 <P>
A Type III shell, a "dyson bubble", would have a very low mass. Since
its density is independent of the radius (see the stability section), its
mass would scale as r^2. For an 1 AU bubble, the total mass needed would be
around 2.17e20 kg, around the mass of Pallas.

<A NAME="HEAT"><H2>
<LI> Wouldn't a Dyson sphere heat up?</H2></A>

Even if the civilisation living in the Dyson sphere did its best to 
store available energy, thermodynamics eventually wins and the 
sphere begins to radiate away energy until equilibrium is reached. 
Its temperature becomes
<BLOCKQUOTE>
T=[E/(4 pi eta sigma r^2)]^(1/4)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

where eta is the emissivity (=1 for a blackbody), sigma the constant 
of Stefan-Bolzman's law (5.67032e-8 Wm^2K^-4)and E the total 
energy output of the star measured in watts. 
 <P>
In theory, if eta is very low the interior of the sphere could become 
as hot as desired, but this is unlikely since the material of the 
sphere would start to melt or evaporate if the temperature moved 
above 2000-3000K or so. And if the surface of the star became hot 
enough, the outer parts of the star would expand and a new 
thermal equilibrium set in with less internal energy production. If 
the sphere was a perfect energy container the star would 
eventually expand until its fusion processeses ended; if the 
temperature was lowered (by energy use) fusion would resume 
until an equilibrium was reached - a bottled star. 
 <P>
It should be noted that at 1 AU, the energy flux is around 1.4e3 
W/m^2, which calculates as around 395 K, or 122 degrees C if the 
sphere is a blackbody. This is a bit too hot for an earthlike 
biosphere (Earth is cooled by its rotation, which effectively halves 
the energy flux, and its spherical shape, that lowers it further), and 
a dyson shell need some rather impressive cooling to work. 
 <P>
The radius of the smallest passively radiating shell with thermal
tolerance T_max is
<BLOCKQUOTE>
r_smallest = sqr(E/(4 pi eta sigma T_max^4))
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Diamond can stand around 4000K; putting 4000K into the equation, 
we get 1.48e9 meters, or around 1.4 million kilometers. For 1000K 
we get a radius of 2.37e10 meters, or around 23 million kilometers. 
This is roughly 2 and 32 solar radii respectively. With active
cooling the shell can be made much smaller. 


<A NAME="OTHER"><H2>
<LI> Other Dyson Sphere-Like Concepts</H2></A>

<H3>Ringworlds</H3>

Ringworlds were introduced by <A HREF="http://malkuth.sephiroth.org/~corwin/authors/lniven/index.html">Larry Niven</A> in <I>Ringworld</I>. A 
ringworld is essentially a band encircling a star, rotating to create 
gravity and covered with an ecosphere. The atmosphere is held in 
by gravity and 1000-kilometre mountain walls at the edges. Day 
and light are provided by a second ring of "shadow squares", black 
rectangles covering the sun during "night". Cooling systems keep 
the climate stable and an automated meteor defence system shoots 
down meteors. 
 <P>
Just as with a type II Dyson sphere the internal stresses would 
require an immensely strong material (Niven uses the invented 
material <I>scrith</I>, a greyish translucent material with strength on 
the order of the nuclear binding strength). The stress is 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
F= r rho g  [N/m]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where rho is the weight of the ringworld per square meter 
(kg/m^2) and g is the surface acceleration and r is the radius. For 
the ringworld g was close to earthly, a radius of around 1 AU and 
there was at least a kilometre of surface material of approximately 
eartlike density. This would provide a stress on the order of 1e18-1e19 N/m.
 <P>
The ringworlds instability is also (in)famous. It is not neutrally 
stable like a dyson sphere, but dynamically unstable - a small disturbance (such 
as the inhomogenities in the solar wind or meteor strikes) will grow 
gradually, and the ringworld would gradually loose its centeredness 
until it runs into its sun (the ringworld is transversely stable, if the 
ring is perturbed along its axis it will oscillate around the 
equilibrium position). See <A HREF="http://www.alcyone.com/max/writing/essays/niven-rings.html">Erik Max Francis' page abour ringworld stability for an easy derivation</A>. Niven solves this problem in <I>Ringworld 
Engineers</I> by placing ramjets along the edges, forming an active 
stabilisation system. 
 <P>
A related idea to ringworlds is Ian Bank's orbitals. An orbital is a
small ringworld orbiting the sun (instead of encircling it; this circumvents
the instability), with a
rotation period of 24 hours and earthlike gravity due to the spin.
Its size would be
<BLOCKQUOTE>
r=g T^2 / (4 pi^2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
which gives a radius of around 2 million kilometers. If the orbital is
tilted and sufficiently broad, it could shade itself to provide day
and night. Note that it still requires superstrong materials, although
less extreme than scrith. 


<H3>Bubbleworld, by Dani Eder &lt; ederd@bcstec.ca.boeing.com&gt;</H3>

A bubbleworld is an artificial construct that consists of a shell of
living space around a sphere of hydrogen gas.  It was invented to
answer the question "what is the largest space colony that can be
built".  The answer is a non-rotating bubbleworld can be as large
as 480,000 km in diameter (about 3 times the diameter of Jupiter), if
you make certain assumptions.  A rotating one is too hard for me
to analyze.
 <P>
Assume that you wish to have a large living volume in the form of
a shell.  The shell contains air, people, houses, furniture, etc.
that averages 10 kg/m^3.  If you fill the interior of the shell with
hydrogen (the lightest gas) at room temperature, it will assume a
distribution based on self-gravity.  If the pressure at the inner
shell boundary, where the hydrogen and living space meet, is 1
atmosphere, then there is a largest size you can build such a structure
before the self-gravity of the hydrogen starts to make it smaller.
 <P>
The living space has a thickness of 2400 km if you assume that the
outer surface is at a pressure equal to that at 3000 m (10,000 ft)
above sea-level on Earth.  Such a bubbleworld would have about 
5 million times the useable living volume of the Earth.  The
atmosphere is held in by a cap of material (such as 500 meters of 
iron-nickel) so as to balance the gas pressure from below.  The
entire structure is in pressure equilibrium, so it requires no
particular structural strength.
 <P>
A rotating bubbleworld would be a flattened ellipsoid and could be
several times larger, but determining the shape is more complicated
than the non-rotating spherical case.
 <P>
The living volume of the Bubbleworld would be in a 0.001 to 0.01
gee environment, making unusual architecture and human-powered
flight possible.  The entire bubbleworld would mass about 3 Earths
in mass.


<H3>SupraJupiter</H3>

Paul Birch suggested that Jupiter could be enclosed in a solid shell;
at a certain radius the surface gravity would be terrestial, and
energy could be provided by tapping the thermal energy of the
planet. 
 <P>
Paul Birch "A Visit to SupraJupiter" <I>Analog</I> December 1992

<H3>Submerged Dyson Spheres</H3>

Nick Szabo proposed that since communications delays are rather
long in a normal-size dyson sphere and energy densities grow as
it becomes smaller, it would be advantageous to build spheres 
closer and closer to the star for advanced "<A HREF="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Words/s.html#SOLID_STATE_CIVILIZATION">solid state civilizations</A>".
The logical conclusion would be a shell around the core of the star, 
through which all energy would be filtered.
 <P>
The problem with this is that the amount of energy that can be extracted
from the radiation depends on the difference in temperature on the
two sides of the shell, and inside the star this will be rather low,
while outside the star the difference will essentially be between the shell 
temperature and the cosmic background radiation. But it should be noted
that if neutrinous can be captured, they would provide a kind of temperature
differential that could be used (since the sun is almost transparent to
them). 

<H3>Galactic Dyson Spheres</H3>

Hara Ra &lt;harara@shamanics.com&gt; suggested that to 
maximize available energy and matter, and
minimize communications delays it would be useful for very advanced
civilizations or beings ("galaxy brains") to gather all the stars
and other matter in the galaxy into a dense region in the core. 
 <P>
The result would be a sphere of carefully aligned orbiting matter
just larger than its Schwartzhild radius, with a black hole in the
middle. Instead of relying on energy from stellar fusion, matter
could be fed into the black hole, releasing energy which would
be used by a surrounding "galactic dyson sphere". The total
size would be on the order of a few light-months. 
 <P>
Using black holes for energy production can also be done using
smaller dyson spheres. A very small black hole will radiate
intense Hawking radiation, quickly loosing its mass. If an equal
amount of mass is swallowed (for example in the form of garbage)
the hole will remain stable, and convert matter into energy
which can be collected by the dyson sphere.
