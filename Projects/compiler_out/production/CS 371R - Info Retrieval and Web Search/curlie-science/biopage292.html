Bryonet is a managed list. All messages come to the owner/manager and are forwarded to the list. The intent of the list is to provide good international discussions and a forum in which teachers, ecologists, bryologists and anyone interested can get questions about bryophytes answered. Since much of bryophyte literature is imbedded in studies of a more general nature, it is often difficult to find answers to ecological, physiological, and other questions. It is appropriate to ask bryological questions, send news items of interest to bryologists, announce bryological meetings and forays, announce publications of interest to bryologists, or ask for help in locating a bryologist or bryological collections. Teachers wanting information on bryophytes are encouraged to bring their questions to the list. Send messages to <bryonet-L@mtu.edu>. Please include your email address in the body of the message if you want a response - some folks will want to respond privately. Be careful not to send personal messages to the list.<br/><br/>If you want to subscribe: mail to: jmglime@mtu.edu with this subject: subscribe bryonet-L your name<br/><br/>To avoid spam subscribers, all subscriptions come to me for approval and I must personally add you to the list. Once I have added your address, you should get a message back telling you about bryonet and how to unsubscribe.<br/><br/>When you subscribe, please include your email address, country affiliation, and your name for our IAB bryonet records.<br/><p>Janice M.
