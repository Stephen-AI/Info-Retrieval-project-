this is a major new paper by the pioneers in the field, so you're going

nobody talks to you anyway, so forget it.  If you are a student, good luck.

<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
All science other than string theory is garbage [1].
Since string field theory is becoming more and more a part of everyday
life (so far, no disagreement has been found with experiment [2]), we here
apply this formalism to the most important string, the super G [2]-string [3].  
(See also [4].)  Strings also provide the only known theories of quantum
gravity which are too complicated to prove wrong, and therefore provide a 
convenient method of turning up our noses at all the ordinary particle 
theorists who haven't even learned general relativity yet.  (Besides, if they
haven't learned strings, they can only be phenomenologists anyway.  This
includes anybody who still calls strings "dual models".)  The super 
G-string can also be used to derive models of GUTS [5] cosmetology
(gastronomy), through the use of string solitons known as "comic
strings" [6], due to their comic proportions.  This string may even solve
problems in the conceptual development of the statistical interpretation
of quantum mecħanics, such as the famous Witten kitten paradox [7].
Strings were originally developed for use in QCD, whatever that was.

</font>
As usual [3,8], we begin by setting up some notational conventions (since
nobody ever invites us to any other kind).  We use Roman indices for
vectors and Greek indices for spinors, except on Thursdays, when we do
the opposite.  This notation is unambiguous, since we use index-free
notation anyway, which means you have to guess what all the indices are.
Sometimes we also use symbol-free notation, so you also have to guess
whether there is an equation there at all.
<p>

The paper is organized as follows:  In the title we tell you what the
paper is about.   Since that's a lie, in the abstract we tell you what
the paper is <i>really</i> about.  That's also a lie, but we need more
space to fully exaggerate our claims.  Since most of the people who
actually read these papers come from institutions so small that their
theory group is abelian, they won't know the difference anyway.
In the introduction we tell you
what we did in the past, carefully referencing all the people who did
unrelated work, while giving only backhanded references to anybody's
papers that might be more interesting than ours (or at least ones that
make even more exaggerated claims).  We also tell you there about our
(disregard for) conventions, and how the paper is organized, and we tell
you how we tell you how the paper is organized, etc.  In the following
section, we test you to see if you're still awake.  In section 3, we
discuss the things we really don't care about, but which boring people
keep asking us about anyway.  In particular, we describe methods which
avoid using the functionals needed in string field theory, for those of
you who are functional illiterates. 
In the next section we explain BRST, which
by now is so well understood that the only thing people don't understand
is what the "T" stands for.  In section 5 we discuss the real world,
and prove that it exists.  (We also sketch a proof that Green and
Schwarz are not the same person.)   Section 6 is a disclaimer, put in
just to reference the work of people who are so important that we are
embarassed to tell them how worthless their recent work is, and to avoid
the whole problem by saying that we really don't understand their work
yet, even though it's so trivial that even our chauffeur knows it's
wrong.  We also have a note added in proof, acknowledging the work of
the referee.  Finally, we have the acknowledgments, as if we didn't know
that we don't really owe anybody anything (except maybe our bookies).

<h2>2. NEW STRING FIELD* THEORY</h2>
<p>
In this section we further develop the NEW (<strong>N</strong>ot <strong>E</strong>d 
<strong>W</strong>itten) 
string field theory [9], which is necessary to formulate the super G-string 
in a way which nobody but us can understand.  (This allows us to publish many
papers before anybody else, since they have to spend most of their time
figuring out our notation.)  Our NEW vertex is

</font>
Fig. 1.  The interacting G-string 3-point vertex
</center>
<p>
Notice that on the right-hand side of the figure there is only a free
string propagator, while on the left-hand side are 3 strings, into which
the propagator is continuously transformed, without introducing any
curvature into the surface.  Thus the interacting G-string follows
directly from the free theory.  (There have been claims that this vertex
is just an optical illusion.  However, the same has been said about the
success of string theory in general.)
<hr>
*Technically speaking, the term
"string field" is self-contradictory, since, as we all know, strings
don't grow in fields, they grow in vineyards.
<p>

<h2>3. PATH-INTEGRAL METHODS</h2>
<p>
Path-integral methods are very convenient for evaluating graphs derived
from string field theory, since they allow us to use the transformations
on the 2-dimensional bull-sheet
resulting from general coordinate and local Weyl scale
transformations, also known as "stretching it".  We discovered this in
 [10].  (Everybody else discovered this much earlier [11], but we don't
recognize them*.)  
In particular, these graphs can easily be 
evaluated by mapping to the upper-half plane:

ALL OUR IMPORTANT RESULTS HERE, SO WE CAN REFERENCE THEM IN A LATER

and even if you could understand it, it wouldn't help you understand the
rest of the paper, which you probably won't understand anyway.
Sometimes we don't know why we even bother to write papers at all.
Well, besides the money.***<br>
***Actually, 
the money isn't all that great either.  At
least not for the paper itself.  However, the residuals tend to make up
for it.  For example, if you would like to see any of our calculations, in
notation which is not symbol-free, it will be very symbol-expensive.  Be
sure to send all your requests with a self-addressed envelope, and
include a check for $10 per equation, plus $5 shipping and handling.

However, in most cases such methods turn out to be
just a lot of "pointless geometry" [12].  Furthermore, this approach
relies on doing first quantization, while, as everyone knows, it's always
easier to do classical first, and second quantization.  Nevertheless,
these geometric methods have the double advantage of allowing the use of
deep mathematical theorems that most physicists never even heard of,
much less understand, so that we can simultaneously use old math that
physicists were never aware of and old physics that mathematicians were
never aware of, and thus excite everybody about something which was
invented by somebody who's long since dead.  In this way, the beauty of
string theory is made very similar to that of classical music, as
suggested by the term "G-string" (although we had a different type of
beauty in mind when we invented the term).

<h2>4. BRST</h2>
<p>
Field theory formulations can be straightforwardly derived by the use of
BRST [13] methods.  For these purposes it is convenient to expand around
flat space, so we first consider the G&#9837;-string.  These
methods can be used to prove that the G-string has 12 sets of auxiliary
fields [14l].  The geometry of the field theory described by Fig. 1 
is necessarily commutative, since the geometry of a closed string is a
ring, and only commutative rings are fields.  The gauge transformations
of the BRST formulation, known as "cordal" transformations [15],
change the geometry of the string so as to produce ropes, or cords:

<h2>5. PHENOMEKNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>
As for all high-energy physics, all string physics (not to be confused with
the old-fashioned topic of particle physics) can be classified into two
types: (1) esthetic and (2) anesthetic.  The former type has the
advantage that, when it is found that either nature disagrees with it or
it is too complicated for anyone to know if they agree with it, it can
still be published in a science fiction magazine or the science section
of a formerly reputable newspaper.  The latter type has the advantage
that seminars on it give needed rest to the many overworked physicists
who have spent many sleepless nights puzzling over theories of the
former type.  Since most of this paper has so far been devoted to type-1
physics, we now digress to type-2 as a respite.  For those who don't
wish to skip this section, we suggest you now place your index finger on
the heading of the following section, to avoid the usual vicious circle
of rereading the paragraph upon awakening which had been forgotten due
to loss of memory in the pre-catatonic state.
<p>
As discussed previously [3], Kalvin-Klein compactification of the G-string to 4
dimensions can be obtained by giving appropiate &sigma;-dependence to the
vector index on the spacetime coordinate x<sup>&mu;(&sigma;)</sup>.  One
observable consequence of this phenomenon is the appearance of extremely
miniscule particles [16] emitted by the compactified dimensions.
Supersymmetry is preserved by the SU(3) holomoney (with flavors &cent;,
$, &pound;), whose cohomology has a topology with good phenomenology.
One useful method to study this behavior is the introduction of massless
background fields, in terms of which an effective action is studied
 [17].  This allows us to ignore all the fields which make string theory
different from ordinary supergravity in the first place, and which we
really didn't want to have to learn about anyway.
<p>

<h2>6. COVARIANTIZING THE LIGHT CONE</h2>
<p>
All these results can be derived from a very general formalism which
encompasses particle physics as well as string physics.  The derivation
of this formalism begins with the description of the string in the
light-cone gauge [18].  This formalism
is closely related to the Paris-is-sewerless formalism, in which the
anticommuting coordinates become the Phantoms of the Operators. 
<p>

<h2>Note added in proof</h2>
<p>
After this work was completed, we became aware that similar results
(including typographical errors) had
been obtained in [19].  However, we have given much neater proofs of the
theorems appearing there by ignoring all the important steps.  Also, we
have included some results which were omitted from the published version
of [19] due to their being incorrect (see also [20]).
<p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>
We would like to thank God it's Friday, for helpful discussions, and for
making [21] available before publication.  (He also informed us that He
was independently aware of many of the results obtained here.)  Also, we
have a lot of friends who have done nothing worthwhile whatsoever on
this topic, which makes us feel sorry for them.  After all, they used to
do pretty important stuff way back during the Middle Ages (i.e., in the
era after the Classical Era of dual models and before the Modern Era of
superstrings).  So we thank them for many useful conversations, mostly
on the weather and mutual funds [22].  Finally, we acknowledge several
people for correcting sign errors and factors of 2 in an earlier version
of this paper, and ask them to mind their own damn business from now on.
