<H2>pandora</H2>This page is intended to distribute the current version of a 
new
physics event generator for linear collider studies, called pandora. The link 
below transmits a tar.gz file containing the C++ code for pandora, and some 
documentation. 
<P>The program pandora is a general-purpose parton-level event generator 
which 
includes beamstrahlung, initial state radiation, and full 
treatment of polarization effects.  (An interface to PYTHIA that produces 
fully hadronized events is described below.)
This version includes the SM physics 
processes: 
<UL>
  <LI>e+e- -&gt; l+l-, q qbar , e+e-, gamma gamma, t tbar, Z gamma, ZZ, W+W- 
  <LI>e+e- -&gt; Z Higgs, nu nubar Higgs, e+e- Higgs, nu nubar gamma 
  <LI>gamma gamma -&gt; l+l-, q qbar, t tbar, e+e-, W+W-, Higgs 
  <LI>e gamma -&gt; e gamma, e Z, nu W 
  <LI>e-e- -&gt; e-e- </LI></UL>
and some illustrative Beyond the SM processes:
<UL>
  <LI>e+e- -&gt; l+l-, q qbar , e+e-,  with a Z' 
  <LI>e+e-  -&gt; l+l-, q qbar , e+e-, gamma gamma, ZZ, W+W-
           with Hewett's contact  interaction for extra dimensions
  <LI>e+e- -&gt;  gamma Graviton
  <LI>e+e- -&gt;  t tbar, with general production and decay form factors
  <LI>e+e- -&gt;  W+W-, with a technirho resonance
</UL>
<P>To download pandora, 
<a href="ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/groups/lcd/Generators/PANDORA/pandora23.tar.gz">
click this link</a> to receive a tar.gz file. 
This download contains all C++ files needed 
to run pandora simulations at the parton level. 
<P>Some sample programs are contained in the directories SMexamples, 
SM3examples, BSMexamples. On a UNIX system, it might well be possible 
to simply enter one of these directories, type (for the program ttevents.cpp,
for example) `make ttevents', and watch the program compile.  More often,
you will need to do some minor tinkering with the makefile (e.g. change
`CC' to `g++' at the top). Programs whose names end in 
`events' generate a few events and output them to the console. Programs which 
end in `example' generate a few thousand events and create histograms of their 
properties as gnuplot (.gp) graphics files. 
<P>Pandora treats e+e- reactions only at the parton level. To include 
hadronization, you need the `pandora_pythia' interface, written by Masako 
Iwasaki. That can be obtained by <a href="PANDORA_PYTHIA.htm">following 
this link</a>. Instructions for download and running of pandora_pythia are 
given on that page. 
<P>A manual for pandora is in preparation.  The manual will come in two 
parts, first, a user's guide to pandora and pandora-pythia, and, second,
a documentation of the internal structure of pandora for those who would
like to write their own processes. <a href=
"ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/groups/lcd/Generators/PANDORA/ppythia.pdf">The
user's guide is now available from this link</a>.
<P>Some less systematic documentation for pandora can be found in the 
documentation directory of this distribution. This directory contains
a pandora.README file with basic information, It also has notes on the 
polarization conventions used in pandora, the modification of beam and
accelerator parameters, and the (still primitive) SUSY processes included. 
<P>The default 
treatment of initial state radiation and beamstrahlung in pandora is 
described in more detail in my note LCC-0010. You can access
that paper from <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~mpeskin/pisin.pdf">this
link</a>.  Please note that the current version of pandora also includes
Ohl's CIRCE 1.0 beamstrahlung parametrizations, as well as the option for 
user-supplied parametrizations.
<P>The current version&nbsp; (3 March 2003) is pandora 2.3.   Earlier 
versions of pandora can be obtained here:
