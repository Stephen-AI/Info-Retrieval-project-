<td width="70%">There is no unanimous agreement on a theory about the origin of life.   Any record would have been erased during the long history of turmoil on the Earth's surface.  However, it is known that it must have happened between 4.5 - 3.7 billion years ago when the Earth's crust solidified and

<li><b>The Environment</b> - Four and a half billion years ago, the <A NAME="proto-Earth"></A><a href="F09-earth.htm#beginning">proto-Earth</a> was completing its formation.  It was still covered with a thick layer of molten lava.  A grazing collision occurred with the subsequent appearance of a transient ring around the Earth that rapidly become the <a href="F07-planets04.htm#Moon">Moon</a>.  Small cometary impacts persisted until about four billion years ago.  The still dense atmosphere had time to stabilize and slowly cool, above oceans which were at first very hot, then tepid.  The number of lagoons and shallows, alternately covered and uncovered by the ebb and flow of the seas, was very great, because the tides were gigantic (with the Moon at least three times closer than at present).  Under these conditions of constant, chaotic change, life could not have formed on the Earth's exterior.  There was </li>

Another essential ingredient is <a href="F12-molecule11.htm#water">water</a>.  It is the fluid that transports the molecular components from one place to another and facilitates the chemical reactions that keep life going. Water serves as a supporting and cleansing fluid, bearing nutrients to where they are needed and taking away wastes.  Furthermore, water is the general purpose solvent for dissolving organic molecules.  If molecules are to be broken down and reconstructed in a controlled way, if information codes are to be translated into working molecules and if information storages are to persist over a long period, only water can satisfy the requirement of providing such a solution in the ranges of temperature and pressure on Earth.  Recent researches indicate that the hydrogen bonds in water may play a role on the <a href="F11-monocell10.htm">folding of protein</a>, and the <a href="F11-monocell08.htm">binding of protein to DNA</a>.

<td width="80%"> The high water content in our body has suggested to many biologists that life on Earth arose in the oceans.  In fact, there is a rough correspondence between the content of such elements as calcium and potassium in seawater and in blood and tissues.  It is thought that living systems tend to incorporate the primitive environment, so that their internal surroundings would tend to resemble the familiar conditions of the early history of life, a possibility first glimpsed by the 19th century French physiologist Claude Bernard.

Note that glycine and alanine are the most abundant amino acids in both cases.  They are the simplest amino acids produced by the most stable codons GGC and GCC (see <a href="F11-monocell09.htm#genetic">genetic code</a>).  Recent research indicates that they are probably the earliest building blocks for life.  Meanwhile, astronomers have detected more than 130 different kinds of organic molecules by 2005 in the giant molecular clouds where stars (and planets) are born.  These range from the simple two-atom molecules such as nitric oxide (NO), to the large cyanopentacetylene (HC<sub>11</sub>N) with chain of 11 carbon atoms.  By 2013, the number of molecular species found in space has increased to about 180 by various means of detection (Figure 11-03c).  It is not known how some of the more complicated arrangements can be formed in the cold-dark inter-stellar space.

The materials of life can be summarized into one category - the <a href="#redox">reduced</a> <a href="F11-monocell02.htm">organic compounds</a>.  The process of reduction stores energy while the carbon in organic substance provides a versatile building block.  There are many theories on the source of such materials, such as lightning in the atmosphere, and delivery by comets as discussed above.  Another suggestion is from the hydrothermal vents located near the mid-ocean ridge.  Hydrocarbons are produced when CO<sub>2</sub> in ocean water meets H<sub>2</sub> in the spring water from the mould (Figure 11-03d) according to the formula :<br/><br/>
CO<sub>2</sub> (dissolved in water as HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) + [2+(m/2n)]H<sub>2</sub> <img src="I15-61-arrow.jpg"> [(1/n)C<sub>n</sub>]H<sub>m</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.  <br/><br/>

Initially, the only safe place for the primitive microorganisms away from the hydrothermal mould was further down through the ocean floor and into the warm, underlying sediments and permeable basalts.  Over millions of years, <a href="F09-earth03.htm">tectonic movement</a> of the Earth's mantle thrust up the ocean floor to form coastal shallows.  A few colonies of bacteria must have found themselves in an optimal position: deep enough to be protected from harmful ultraviolet light, but shallow enough to use radiation at longer wavelength to make more organic molecules from carbon dioxide.  That's when <a href="R10-23-plants.htm#photoevo">blue-green algae</a> (cyanobacteria) started the photosynthesis process.  The rest is history of other <a href="R10-23-plants.htm#PreCambrian">Era</a>.<br/><br />
The definition of proto-life is : "Complex organic forms thought to represent the stage immediately prior to the evolution of the first living organisms."  Accordingly at the very beginning, such entities would incorporate all kinds of chemical elements in the trial and error process until something conducive to life came up.  It would be at this point when Darwinian selection took over initiating the evolution toward life.

Now, even if water and the basic organic molecules are somehow available in the early Earth's environment, there were no <a href="F11-monocell10.htm">enzymes</a> (themselves made of proteins) available in the primordial soup.

But it has been shown that polymerization of amino acids can occur when exposed to dry heat.  Another possible way around this problem is the use of inorganic catalysts such as the surface of some mineral or between layers of clay (Figure 11-03e) to perform the function.  A 2010 study indicates that cyclic nucleotides (Figure 11-03f), which are a chemical variation of the nucleotides that make up RNA, will spontaneously link to each other and form viable RNA chains.  Thus, if there were cyclic nucleotides in the primordial soup, catalyst was not needed to start life.  It is further conjectured that such reactions were </td>

The <A NAME="pre-RNA"></A>pre-RNA world in the next diagram shows a short strand of nucleic acids (a nucleotide chain) undergoing binary fission with mutation.  
However, it is estimated that without the assistance from the enzymes even a short strand will take too long to form with random encounters.

The oxidation and reduction always run in pair by the conservation of charge.  Figure 11-03g shows a typical redox reaction in the form of cellular respiration via hydrogen exchange.  Since the electron has higher mobility, it is not necessarily associated directly with the reactants.  Figure 11-03h shows a recent study of H<sub>2</sub>S oxidization by bacteria in marine sediment.  This reaction is coupled to the oxygen-reduction in the oxic layer (to form H<sub>2</sub>O) via rapid electron transfer (instead of hydrogen exchange).

Redox potential is a measure of the tendency of compounds or elements to deliver electrons (and other modes of oxidation).  It is defined as the electrode potential on the hydrogen scale (H<sub>2</sub> <img src="I15-61-arrow.jpg" width="2%"> 2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup>)  with a value of E<sub>0</sub> = -0.42 volt (V) at pH 7.0 (= 0 at pH 0).  Figure 11-03i shows the E<sub>0</sub> value for several redox reactions.  The free energy <img src="I15-19-delta.jpg">G is a measure of the maximum work that can be obtained from a reaction.  It is related to the difference in E<sub>0</sub> before and after the reaction.  Its value is positive for gaining energy in the case of oxidation, and negative implying infusion of energy in reduction such as the processes (1) and (2).

<li><b>The Transition</b> - This is actually a misnomer because it is inherently difficult to define "what is life".  It is now understood that life arose as a gradual, sequential process of emergent steps from geo-chemical simplicity to biological complexity.  We are poised to reproduce those enigmatic transitional states in the laboratory, and with luck might discover them frozen on other worlds. But picking a step to represent the transition from non-life to life is still intrinsically arbitrary.  A "working definition" for life in the context of space exploration states : "Life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing <a href="F11-monocell14.htm">Darwinian evolution</a>."    Thus, any form of life must be a chemical system.  Life also grows and sustains itself by gathering energy and molecules from its surroundings - the essence of metabolism.

<br/><br/> 
<a name="protocell"></a>Starting in 1991,  biochemist <a href="https://molbio.mgh.harvard.edu/szostakweb/index.html">Jack Szostak</a> (and his graduate students) has embarked on a project to recreate life in the laboratory from where Stanley Miller left off.  Followings is a summary of their accomplishments up till 2004:<br /><br />
<li>By a process of artificial selection, a ribozyme (an enzyme made from RNA instead of protein) was created to copy up to 14 nucleotides from an RNA with an accuracy of roughly 97%.  (By 2013 it is reported that the 202 nucleotides long RNA enzyme can produce 206 nucleotides long RNA at -17<sup>o</sup>C)</li>
<li>Fatty acids were used to form bubbles (for cell membranes) known as vesicles.  These vesicles could grow and divide as they were forced through 100-nanometer-wide pores - an "early earth" simulation of the pores in rocks around hydrothermal vents.  It is also found that by adding a kind of clay known as montmorillonite to the solution of fatty acids, it sped up the rate of vesicle formation 100-fold.</li>
<li>It was discovered that in a mixture of RNA, fatty acids and clay, the clay can cause nucleotides to spontaneously assemble </li>

<td width="80%">themselves into RNA, which is then automatically trapped inside the fatty acid bubbles.  The result is something that resembles a cell: It has genetic material and water contained within a waterproof fatty-acid pouch.  Figure 11-04h is an image of these makeshift cells taken with an optical microscope and enhanced using fluorescent dye, it reveals yellow bits of RNA inside spherical green vesicles.  They have not created life yet.  It will be their next step to assemble a system of ribozyme, RNA and vesicle.  This system has to grow, divide, and evolve  in order to make the transition to life.  Once there's one example of a lab system that's evolving by itself, then the challenge is to build systems that can evolve under different conditions such as the high-pressure liquid hydrogen in Jupiter and Saturn. By the summer of 2007, Jack Szostak predicts that within the next six months, scientists will be able to create a cell membrane using fatty acids. </td>

evolution could simply take over.  A <a href="http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/szostakweb/publications.html">June 2008 publication</a> by him indicates that early proto-cells with fatty-acid-based membrances could not have been autotrophs (with nourishment generated within).  Such early cells were more like the heterotrophic model, which emerged from very simple cellular structures within a complex environment that provides external sources of nutrients and energy.<br /><br /><a name="Szostak2010"></a>
In a 2010 <a href="http://www.NewScientist.com">NewScientist</a> article, Szostak indicates that the mere presence of RNA could drive vesicle growth by stealing membrane molecules from neighboring vesicles that contain less or no RNA.  The physics behind the process is that RNA inside vesicles exerts an osmotic pressure on the inside of these sacs.  This internal pressure places tension on the membrane, which grows by absorbing molecules from surrounding vesicles that are less swollen as a consequence of having a smaller cargo of genetic material.  Thus protocells with more RNA inside would grow faster.  Then it is discovered that when the vesicle has grown big enough (to about 4 micrometers), the spherical vesicle turns into a long, filamentous structure so fragile that it divides into daughter vesicles just by gentle shaking, i.e., the cell has divided.  The next step is to check out how a primitive RNA might have catalyzed the synthesis of phospholipids - a class of lipids that are a major component of modern cell membranes.<br/><br/>
In 2017, Szostak has to retract a paper on <a href="R10-38-life.htm#aaRS">RNA replication</a>, which is an important step from non-life to life (see "<a href="http://www.frontlinegenomics.com/news/17272/nobel-laureates-make-mistakes-jack-szostak-retracks-nature-chemistry-paper/">Nobel Laureates Make Mistakes Too: Jack Szostak Retracts Nature Chemistry Paper</a>").  Although disappointed that the approach does not work, he is returning to the drawing board to look at alternative ways to overcome this roadblock.

<li>Eutectic Freezing - As an ice crystal forms, only molecules of water join the growing crystal, while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded.  These impurities become crowded in the microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice and thus there are more chance for the formation of a variety of macro-molecules such as the <a href="F11-monocell05.htm">nucleotides</a>.

Meanwhile on Earth, there are bacteria which can survive very harsh condition on another planet. In an Earth lab, Deinococcus radiodurans (D. rad) can withstand extreme levels of radiation, extreme temperatures, dehydration, and exposure to genotoxic chemicals. They even have the ability to repair their own DNA, usually within 48 hours. Known as an extremophile, bacteria such as D. rad are of interest to NASA partly because they might be adaptable to help human astronauts survive on other worlds. A recent map of D. rad's DNA might allow biologists to augment their survival skills with the ability to produce medicine, clean water, and oxygen. Already they have been genetically engineered to help clean up spills of toxic mercury. Likely one of the oldest surviving life forms, D. rad was discovered by accident in the 1950s when scientists investigating food preservation techniques could not easily kill it. In Figure 11-04n Deinococcus radiodurans grow quietly in a petri dish.</td>

In early December 2010, NASA announced that bacteria found in the arsenic-filled water of a Californian lake (the Mono Lake, see Figure 11-04o) seems to be able to replace phosphorus P with arsenic As in some of its basic cellular processes.  As is in the same group of P in the <a href="F13-atom.htm#periodic">periodic table</a>.  The arsenate ion, AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, has the same <a href="I11-84-phosphate.png">tetrahedral structure</a> and bonding sites as phosphate PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>,

<td width="85%">Further scrutiny of the arsenic data indicates that the microbe is not using the arsenic, but instead is scavenging every possible phosphate molecule while fighting off arsenic toxicity.  As shown in Figure 11-04p, the cell's large vacuoles may be their way of sequestering the arsenic.  It is also noted that the cells grown in high concentrations of arsenate did not seem to contain any RNA - possibly because RNA production had shut down to conserve phosphate. </td>

After 18 months of controversy, further <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/arsenic-loving-bacterium-needs-phosphorus-after-all-1.10971">investigations</a> reveal that the bacteria somehow become arsenate-resistant, and can efficiently extract nutrients from extremely phosphorus-poor environments.  But they would not survive without the support of phosphorus.  The original author now retorts : "how do these bacteria thrive in lethal concentrations of arsenic? And where does the arsenic go?"

<b>(h) Synthetic Life (2018 Update) -</b><br/><br/>
Investigation of the "Origin of Life" usually adopts a top-down approach starting from a known process and searching for the parts that make it tick.  The other methodology is bottom-up by running experiments to see "How Life can be Created from Non-living Matter".  This is called "Synthetic Life" (Figure 11-04q).

<li><b>Cell Membrance - </b>It is well known that macromolecules such as phospholipid can naturally form a 3-D sphere bound by a membrane in water (the droplet is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome">liposome</a>, Figure 11-04t).  In anticipation of making the cell to divide, the surface or its interior was laced with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_System">Min proteins</a> which generate some sort of oscillation to specify the mid-zone of the a divdiding cell.  Initial problem of instability was overcome by special setup such as the one shown in Figure 11-04r.  The researchers then experimented with pressurizing, deforming and reshaping the liposomes to take on non-spherical shapes that mimic cells better. They also designed a chip that could mechanically split a liposome in two by pushing it up against a sharp point.  It is recognized that this is not cell division in real life.

<li><b>Metabolism - </b>There may be some chemical reactions occuring in a bag of randomly gathered macromoleucles (Figure 11-04u), but the process would be very slow and would come to a halt without suitable enzymes and energy infusion.

They managed to load <a href="R10-11-gradient01.htm#ATP">ATP synthase</a> into the vesicle and try to mimic the production of ATP to supply bio-energy as in real cell.  Another group is interested in pathways that allow photosynthetic microbes to pull carbon dioxide from the environment and make sugars and other cellular building blocks.  They found 17 enzymes from 9 different organisms to perform the task getting only an inefficient and slow reaction so far.</li>
