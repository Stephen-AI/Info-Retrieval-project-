I have come to realise that this is probably not going to happen in the very near future - administration is a time-devouring monster.<BR>However, while the <B>sequence database will stay in the resting state</B> for the time to come, I will do my best to keep the <B>other information on the AAA site up-to-date: AAA meeting announcements, list of AAA researchers, job offers, and relevant links.</B> <H2><A HREF="/AAA/Default.html">The AAA Superfamily</A></H2>The <STRONG>AAA</STRONG> protein superfamily ("<EM>Triple A</EM>", <STRONG>A</STRONG>TPases <STRONG>A</STRONG>ssociated with various cellular <STRONG>A</STRONG>ctivities) is a very old invention of evolution and a fairly recent discovery of science. Over 300 known members in at least 6 families serving different functions make it difficult to keep an overview. This server is intended to help by displaying a <A HREF="/AAA/Tree.html">phylogenetic tree</A> of the superfamily which, as a clickable map, provides easy access to some basic information, references and database links (including Medline links for the references) for all known AAA proteins (known to me, that is). For scientists with a non-graphical browser, a <A HREF="/AAA/List.html">list of sequence names</A> is provided. You can also <A HREF="/AAA/SearchAAA.html">search the AAA database</A> for sequence names (including synonyms), host organisms, protein functions, or authors of papers about AAA members.<P>The tree was updated on February 3, 1997 and includes the complete sets of AAA members of an eukaryote (Saccharomyces), five eubacteria and an archebacterium (extracted from their completely sequenced genomes). <H3><A HREF="/AAA/AAA-Researchers.html">List of AAA Researchers</A>, <A HREF="/AAA/AAA-Jobs.html">Job Offers</A> for research on AAA, and <A HREF="/AAA/NewsFlash.html">the announcement of the next AAA meeting</A></H3> Especially for scientists new to the subject of AAA proteins, <A HREF="/AAA/AAA-Researchers.html">this list</A> is meant to provide a starting point to get into contact with fellow researchers. If you are looking for postdocs, doctoral students, fellows for your AAA research, send me an e-mail (and please inform me when the respective position is taken to have the notice removed). If on the other hand you want to start working on the AAA family (a wise decision garanteeing an exiting and successful future) check <A HREF="/AAA/AAA-Jobs.html">here</A> for your next position. Your best chance to meet other AAA researchers is, of course, on the <B>next (9<sup>th</sup>) AAA Meeting</B>, which will be organized by <B><A HREF="mailto:ogura@gpo.kumamoto-u.ac.jp">Teru Ogura</A></B>, Kumamoto University, Japan, Yukio Fujiki and Tsutomo Katayama, both Kyushu University, Japan, and will take place <B>in Kumamoto, Japan, November 6 - 10, 2011</B> at the <A HREF="http://www.kumamoto-if.or.jp/kcic/default_e.asp">Kumamoto City International Center</A>. The conference will feature advances in the areas of structure and mechanism of AAA<sup>+</sup> proteins, a variety of cellular functions and role of AAA<sup>+</sup> proteins in diseases. For details and for registration, see the <A HREF="http://www.9thaaa.org">AAA conference web site</A>. <br>A special issue of Journal of Structural Biology on AAA<sup>+</sup> proteins will be published in conjunction with the conference.<P>  <H2><A HREF="/Archiv/Index.html">Mac Software on our Server</A></H2>Some Hypercard* stacks (=&gt; Macintosh) for scientific use I have written, and detailed documentation in German and English. Most of these programs are also available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.bio.indiana.edu/molbio/mac/">Bio.Indiana</A> and the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/mac/">EBI</A>.<P>If you have a Mac and the need to draw plasmids and/or to organize plasmid collections, you should not miss my newest software. Get an impression of <A HREF="/Archiv/PlasmidMaker.html">Plasmid-Maker</A> and <A HREF="/Archiv/PlasmidCollection.html">Plasmid Collection</A>!<BR>The <A HREF="/Archiv/SeqSimPresenter.html">SeqSimPresenter</A> (Version 1.02) now works with Hypercard Versions &gt; 2.1.<BR  CLEAR=left><H2><A HREF="/HyperCGI.html">Using HyperCard* as a CGI application</A></H2>I use HyperCard scripts for searching the AAA database and some other databases. HyperCard may not be the ideal application for that task, but it is easy to program and I want to share some hints which speed processing and avoid other problems using HyperCard as a CGI application. <BR><A HREF="/HyperCGIDemo.html"><IMG SRC="/Icons/new_tiny.gif" ALT="new" ALIGN=left HSPACE=5 VSPACE=4 HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=32></A>Get my HyperCGI example, a <A HREF="/HyperCardCGI.hqx">simple address database</A> fully accessable via the WWW. <A HREF="/HyperCGIDemo.html">A description</A> is also included in the archive.<P>*Sadly, the new generation of Macs will not be able to run Hypercard, as Apple has abandoned one of its greatest mind children. There will not be much requirement for a Hypercard based web database or other hypercard applications in the near future :(.<BR  CLEAR=left><H2><A HREF="/Lab.html">Our Lab</A> and <A HREF="/Projects.html">Our Projects</A></H2>Of course, we are working on the AAA superfamily, namely on CDC48p and its close relatives, and use the yeast <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> as a model for human beings.
