These notes have been written in 1965 in the following occasion.<P>

<EM>On Niels Bohr's 80 birthday - October 7, 1965 - the Institute for
Theoretical Physics of the University of Copenhagen will be given the
name it has had unofficially for many years: </EM>
<DL>
<DD><STRONG>The Niels Bohr Institute</STRONG>
</DL>
<EM> It is the purpose of these lines to present a short survey of the
development of the Institute, so intimately connected with Bohr's
life-work as a physicist.</EM><P>

<H4>The Founding of the Institute</H4>

Niels Bohr's first epoch-making papers on the quantum theory of atomic
structure were published in 1913. Building on Ernest Rutherford's
discovery of the atomic nucleus and the existence of the universal
quantum action first recognized by Max Planck, Bohr formulated his
"quantum postulates". On the basis of these postulates he succeeded in
explaining in a convincing manner the structure of the hydrogen spectrum
and thereby took a decisive step in the founding of modern atomic theory.<BR>

Niels Bohr was at that time assistant professor at the University of
Copenhagen. In 1914, Rutherford invited him to take over the readership
in mathematical physics at the University of Manchester, where the
stimulating atmosphere had been such an inspiration to Bohr during a
previous stay. Two years later, in 1916, he was appointed professor to
the newly created chair of theoretical physics in the University of
Copenhagen. <BR>

In the beginning, Bohr had only a small office on S&oslash;lvgade at his
disposal and he was assisted by a secretary and a mechanic. His first
scientific assistant was the young Dutch physicist Kramers. Soon Bohr
took the initiative in establishing an institute to further the research
in atomic physics, the future of which seemed so promising. A site on
Blegdamsvej was purchased with funds collected by a group of far-sighted
persons and the building was erected by the State. The Carlsberg Foundation
contributed annual grants in support of the scientific investigations.
The Institute was completed in 1921 and Niels Bohr continued as director
until his death in November 1962.<BR>

Although the Institute was connected with a chair in theoretical physics
and was denoted accordingly, its working domain included experimental
investigations in the field of atomic physics. Indeed, Bohr laid great
emphasis on the close contact between theoretical and experimental
physicists. The experimental work at the Institute concentrated mainly
on spectroscopy investigations, which played a prominent part in
testing and stimulating the development of atomic theory.

<H4>The Development of Atomic Physics</H4>

Already during the first years after the establishment of the Institute,
many young physicists from abroad came to Copenhagen in order to join
the investigations in atomic theory and to participate in experimental
research. Important progress was achieved in these years through Niels
Bohr's explanation of the periodic system of the elements. This
interpretation was soon given striking confirmation in Coster and
Hevesy's discovery of a new element, which was found to possess just
the properties predicted by the theory. The existence of the element
was demonstrated in X-ray spectra taken at the Institute, and it was
named Hafnium. <BR>

In order to provide increased possibilities for the experimental work and
to make room for the growing number of collaborators from Denmark and
abroad, an extension of the Institute was soon needed. The means for this
extension, which took place in 1924-26, were made available by the
International Education Board (later Rockefeller Foundation) in the
U.S.A., and the additional land was put at the disposal of the Institute
by the municipality of Copenaghen. <BR>

The development initiated by Niels Bohr's work in 1913 reached its climax
in the middle of the twenties. Though an intense collaboration between
physicists from many different countries, unique in its kind in the
history of science, there was created a new physics - quantum mechanics -
which provided the basis for a comprehensive description of atomic
phenomena. The Institute became a meeting place for atomic physicists
coming to Copenhagen to learn Bohr's views on this development and
to work under his inspiring guidance. From the group associated with
the Institute came many of the fundamental contributions to the new
atomic theory. <BR>

The great progress in understanding the constitution of atoms made
possible a deeper insight into the properties of matter, and new prospects
were opened within wide domains of science. Many of the physicists
at the Institute took up the problem of applying the quantum description
to numerous branches of physic, chemistry, astronomy and biology. <BR>

It became increasingly clear to the group in Copenhagen that the departure
from ordinary "classical" physical concepts implied by the new mechanics
was even more radical than had been envisaged earlier. Following
Heisenberg's formulation of the indeterminacy relations, Bohr took a
decisive step in the recognition that our position as observers of
atomic phenomena is different in principle from that in which we find
ourselves when studying the events of every-day life. It is i the nature of
the quantum phenomena that the interaction with the measuring instruments
cannot be made arbitrarily small. Atomic properties observed under
different experimental conditions cannot, therefore, be combined in the
usual manner. Bohr used the word "complementarity" to characterise the
relationship between apparently contradictory phenomena which only
together give a complete description. The epistemological aspects of these
questions became a recurring theme in the discussions at the Institute, and
Bohr used examples from other domains of experience to exhibit the great
scope of the idea of complementarity. 

<H4>Nuclear Physics</H4>

In the years of break-through in atomic physics, interest had been focussed
on the outer structure of atoms. Gradually, however, the problem of the
properties of atomic nuclei and elementary particles came into the
foreground. The construction of accelerators which could produce energetic
beams of ions was of great importance. If the energy is sufficiently high,
the ion can penetrate into the nucleus and in this way produce a
multitude of reactions. At an early stage of this development, it became
possible for the Institute to participate in the promising field of research
due to the installation of new laboratories with a high voltage generator
and a cyclotron. Funds for these instruments were made available by the
Carlsberg Foundation and the Thrige Foundation as well as the Rockefeller
Foundation. <BR>

Nuclear reactions can also be initiated by neutron bombardment, and in
these years radium-beryllium sources were used to produce neutrons.
On the occasion of Niels Bohr's fiftieth birthday, a group of Danish
enterprises and foundations presented him with funds for the purchase
of a strong radium source. <BR>

In the latter part of the thirties, Niels Bohr and his co-workers
contributed important ideas to the understanding of nuclear structure.
Essential features of nuclear reactions could be explained on the
basis of a comparison of the nucleus with a liquid drop. <BR>

When uranium fission was discovered, Frisch and Meitner were able to give
the first interpretation of this new process on the basis of Bohr's
liquid drop model. Working with the Institute's high voltage
generator and the radium-beryllium sources, they also succeeded in
demonstrating the large energy released in the fission process. In the same
year, 1939, Niels Bohr recognized the different roles of the two uranium
isotopes in the fission of naturally occurring uranium. This fact was to
play a very important role in the technical development which soon led to
the release of atomic energy. <BR>

The cyclotron was used not only for the study of nuclear reactions, but
also for the production of radioactive isotopes for biological research.
Hevesy was the first to recognise the vast perspectives opened by the
use of induced radioactivity in biological studies. From 1934 to 1943
he directed the biological tracer work at the Institute, and he and his
coworkers established close collaboration with biologists and doctors
in a number of research centres in Copenhagen. Deriving a lifelong
interest in biological problems from his father, Niels Bohr gave
enthusiastic support to the endeavours of the Institute in this field.<BR>

<H4>The War Years</H4>

From the early thirties, the political development in Europe affected
international scientific cooperation. The group of visitors at the
Institute contained an increasing number of scientists who on their
escape from Nazism had found a refuge in Copenhagen. Some of them remained
in Denmark, while the majority proceeded with Bohr's help to England
and the United States. <BR>

After the occupation in 1940, the Institute became isolated from the
rest of the world, but work continued. In 1943, Niels Bohr had to
escape to Sweden in order to avoid arrest. Subsequently, the Institute was
occupied by the German authorities for a few months. <BR>

During the last two years of the war, Niels Bohr participated in the
Anglo-American atomic energy project. From the outset he recognized
the far-reaching consequences of this revolutionary enterprise. To the
leading statesmen he emphasised the decisive significance of
openness between nations in the new situation which was both dangerous and
at the same time held great promises for mankind. During the years
following the war, and until his death, Niels Bohr strove untiringly
to promote the acceptance of these ideas, and to foster the development
of open international cooperation.<BR>

<H4>The Years after the War</H4>

Niels Bohr returned to Denmark in August 1945 and immediately began to
plan an extension of the Institute to permit active participation 
in nuclear research which was rapidly developing. This expansion,
which was financed by the State and took place during 1946--48, was
also aimed at training additional numbers of students in recognition of
the increasing role of atomic physics in postwar society. Again the
Carlsberg Foundation and the Thrige Foundation provided large 
grants to scientific research. <BR>

Investigation carried out in many different countries disclosed regularities
in the properties of atomic nuclei that could not be understood 
on the basis of the liquid drop model and which had to be ascribed to 
the motion of individual protons and neutrons in the nucleus. 
In the following years, these problems became a main topic of the work 
at the Institute. A close interplay between theoretical and experimental
investigations has led to a more comprehensive description of the nucleus,
comprising the motion of the individual particles as well as the collective
types of motion which were first suggested by the liquid drop model. <BR>

The construction of still more powerful accelerators has made it possible
to explore the structure of the "elementary particles". The study
of atomic reactions at very high energies has resulted in the discovery 
of a richness of new phenomena which have increased our knowledge 
of the fundamental laws of nature. This latest branch of atomic 
physics---high energy physics---is another focus of interest for the work
of the Institute. When the European Organisation for Nuclear Research
(CERN) was established in 1952, the Institute was host to the CERN 
theoretical study group for a number of years. <BR>

Immediately after the war, the Institute resumed its international 
contacts and again a large number of physicists from many countries
came to Copenhagen, contributing to a fruitful scientific environment.
For the last ten years (1955--1965), the Ford Foundation has provided 
funds for the support of international cooperation at the Institute. <BR>

To promote cooperation in the field of theoretical atomic physics among
the Scandinavian countries, the Nordic Institute for Theoretical 
Atomic Physics (Nordita) was established in 1956 through an agreement
between the five governments. This new organisation works in intimate
association with the Niels Bohr Institute and is located in the 
buildings at Blegdamsvej. Nordita offers fellowships to junior 
Scandinavian physicists for participation in the scientific work 
in Copenhagen and has succeeded in attracting a number of prominent
scientists from abroad. 

<H4> Present (1965!) activities of the Institute </H4>

In recent years, the field of activity of the Institute has been 
considerably broadened, in keeping with the expansion of physics 
all over the world. A large part of the advanced teaching in 
physics at Copenhagen University takes place at the Institute. <BR>

The experimental equipment is especially oriented towards problems 
of nuclear structure and high energy physics. The cyclotron, now
more than 25 years old, has been reconstructed many times and has
continued to be a valuable instrument for nuclear investigations.
The old high voltage machine has been replaced by electrostatic 
accelerators producing ion beams of higher energy. <BR>

A large electrostatic generator of the so-called tandem type was
acquired in 1959 and has been of great value to the whole nuclear
research work at the Institute. Because of inadequate space at 
Blegdamsvej, this accelerator was placed on a site close to that of the
Atomic Energy Establishment at Ris&oslash;, about 20 miles west of
Copenhagen. <BR>

Spectroscopic studies of the radiation from radioactive nuclei have
likewise played an important part in the study of nuclear structure,
and the Institute is also participating in this line of research. <BR>

The high energy experimental program at the Institute is based on the
analysis of bubble chamber exposures made at CERN in Geneva. Studies 
are also being made of the production of elementary particles in cosmic
radiation. <BR>

The work of the theoretical group comprises a broad section of modern 
physics, even though the main emphasis is on nuclear physics and 
high energy physics. <BR>

After Niels Bohr's death, his scientific papers were deposited at the
Institute, as an archive in which source material for the study of the
history of quantum physics is being collected. <BR>

At the present time (1965!), the staff of the Institute includes about 
forty scientists, and a similar number of physicists from abroad 
participate each year in the work at the Institute, in addition to
the Nordita physicists (about 20). In the course of the years, more
than 600 physicists from c. 40 different countries have been associated
with the Institute. <BR>

To Niels Bohr international cooperation was a decisive element in the 
development of science. He understood how fruitful personal contacts
can be and attached a great value to the friendships thus established,
recognising also their importance as a means of furthering understanding
between nations. From the outset, the Institute thus became a meeting place
for the new generation of atomic physicists. Through the years, the contacts
of the Institute with the community of physicists in all parts of the world
has been steadily expanded, and this participation in international 
cooperation will continue to be an important aspect of the activities of 
the Institute.

<H4>Recollections from the first Copenhagen conference</H4>
<H4>L. Rosenfeld</H4>

<EM>These notes were written in the occasion of the Fiftieth
Anniversary of the Niels Bohr Institute -- March 3, 1971.</EM>

<P>

Although in the historical perspective the first Copenhagen conference in
1929 rather marks the completion of a heroic period in the life of the
Institute than the initiation of its activity fifty years ago, the 
celebration of the jubilee may be a fitting occasion for calling up 
recollections of an elating week when the Copenhagen spirit hovered over
the troubled waters from which quantum theory had just emerged. 
The circumstances of this gathering loom large in my own memory: I
was then a mere tiro, and the pictures I have kept of the events has
all he vividness of the first glimpse into a wonderful world; I have
therefore no scruple to revive it, as a testimony of the mood in which 
a new generation was then taking the cue from the pioneers to carry on
the unending quest. In fact, I have once before written down some of 
my impressions of this famous week under the title "My initiation",
which conveys this mood. It was a lighthearted, but truthful tale, 
which had the honour of publication in the 1945 issue of the 
<EM>Journal of Jocular Physics</EM>; I do not want the present account to
be much more solemn, and I shall take the liberty of quoting occasionally 
from the previous one. <P>

As most good things in the world, the idea of this conference was due to
chance. In Bohr's own words: <EM>Der Plan zu dieser Konferenz ist dadurch
entstanden, dass mehrere Physiker, die fr&uuml;her hier gearbeitet
haben, besuche in Kopenhagen in den Osterferien angemeldet haben.
Da wir unter anderen auf die Anwesenheit von Kramers und Pauli rechnen,
wird es wohl zu lebhaften und lehrreichen Diskussionen Anlass geben 
k&ouml;nen ...</EM> <A NAME="backh1" HREF="#refh1">[1]</A>
It was quite in line with Bohr's paternal attitude that this fortuitous
conjunction of visits should have prompted him to summon a full-scale
family reunion. Not all could manage to be there, but a good twenty of
them from all over Europe responded to the call: from Cambridge, Bohr's
old friend from the Manchester time, Darwin; from Leiden another near
friend, one of the great masters from the classical era, Ehrenfest,
accompanied by one of his youngest students, Casimir; from Utrecht, Bohr's
first collaborator, Kramers, who had left Copenhagen three years
before to take up the Utrecht chair; from Z&uuml;rich came Pauli, who
with his acutely critical mind, was already then, as Bohr used to put it,
"the conscience of the physicists"; further from Holland, Germany
and Scandinavia a number of those who, each in his domain of predilection,
had shared in the edification of the atomic theory: Goudsmit and Kronig,
H&uuml;ckel, Fues, Jordan, Heitler and Nordheim, Rosseland, Holtsmark and
Waller. My own good luck was due to the circumstance that I had some time
before written to Bohr to enquire whether I could come to work under his
guidance; he generously counted me as a disciple <EM>in spe</EM>.
At the time, four foreign visitors were staying in Copenhagen; they
added their disctintive features to a variegated assembly: Mott's
Cantabrigian elegance, Trumpy's Norse cheerfulness, the quiet
composure of the Chinese Chou were overshadowed by the whimsical
fantasy that Gamow had brought to the West from the lively group of
young Soviet physicists. As to the Institute's staff, it consisted
of two experimenters, S. Werner and J.C. Jacobsen, and of Bohr's
closest collaborator, Oskar Klein, who had succeeded Kramers and
Heisemberg in this position of trust. Among the handful of Danish
students who attended the proceedings, we find the familiar names
of Christian M&oslash;ller, Bengt Str&ouml;mgren, Mogens Pihl and
the regretted Ebbe Rasmussen. <P>

The conference was due to start on Monday the 8th of April, and
a number of the pilgrims travelled on the preceding Sunday. They
all met inevitably on the deck of the ferry from Warnem&uuml;nde to
Gedser. There was much handshaking, exchange of news and shop talk.
This was my  maiden trip, and a propitious day for a first view of
the Danish scenery, in the timid budding of spring, with flags daily
flying in front of every thatch roofed farmhouse (not, as I learned
from my more experienced companions, in honour of the conference,
but just as a weekly manifestation of homely content). The old-fashioned
look of the ferries and railway carriages, the queer funnels of the
locomotives, the easy-going demeanour of the railway people and of the
local passengers at the cosy red-brick stations where the train
unhurriedly lingered, all concurred to build up the impression of a
simple-minded, un demanding peasant community, happily confined to
its own well protected little world. Tourist agents had not yet discovered
how idyllic a country it was, how wonderful its capital. <BR>

The pleasant feeling of old-time hospitality conveyed by the Danish
countryside came to a climax on our arrival at Copenhagen. Niels Bohr
himself was awaiting us on the platform, together with his brother
Harald, his lieutenant Klein and a few boys of various sizes, obviously
his sons. I recognized Harald, whose lectures on almost periodic functions
I ha attended in G&ouml;ttingen, and I shook hands with Niels for the
first time. He received me with a broad, benevolent smile; I was  struck
by the cordial simplicity  with which he greeted old friends and newcomers
alike. Fro the station I strolled to the boarding house I had been assigned,
on the Vester Boulevard, then a spacious promenade lined with stately elms,
which formed a worthy setting for the little trumpeter's eternally
unavailing last call. At dinner, I had occasion to experience how the Danes
could sometimes overdo their hospitable attentions. They subjected me to
the ordeal of pronouncing <EM>r&oslash;dgr&oslash;d med fl&oslash;de</EM>,
and adding insult to injury, expected me to find the stuff delicious. <P>

On the next morning, we all flocked to the Institute lecture room; old
acquaintances were reniewed, new ones formed. I happened to be nearby when a
beaming Ehrenfest came in and went straight to greet Bohr, followed by a
tall, fair-haired, rosy-cheecked youth of rather indolent gait, who did
not quite know what to do with his arms. <EM>Ich bringe Dir diesen
Knaben</EM>,
he said to Bohr, while he affectionately put his hand on the boy's shoulder.
<EM>Er kann shon was, aber er braucht noch Pr&uuml;gel</EM>.
Well, in the course
of the week, Casimir was going to show us, unobtrusively, that he indeed
could do something. Goudsmit was then applying his extraordinary skill
to the classification of hyperfine spectra and was naturally anxious to know
what the contribution of the electron spin to the hyperfine structure
would look like. As soon as he heard Goudsmit mention the problem, Casimir
keenly responded: he asked Goudsmit some brief questions and, lost in
meditation, withdrew to a quiet corner; but let us hear the story from
himself <A NAME="backh2" HREF="#refh2">[2]</A>:
<EM>At the time of the conference Dirac's theory of the spinning
electron was still fairly new ... I had studied the paper and also Weyl's
Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik and had been much impressed by the
beautiful simplicity of the current distribution in the fundamental state
of the hydrogen atom. So when Goudsmit asked me whether I could calculate
the hyperfine interaction in a S state I realized at once that one had only
to calculate the magnetic field of the current. I arrived  at the formula
</EM>
<P>
<IMG ALT="DELTA E = ..." SRC="NBI-HISTORY/frm1.gif">
<BR>
<EM>where the nuclear moment is given by
<IMG ALT="Nuclear moment" SRC="NBI-HISTORY/frm2.gif">.
Goudsmit supplied an estimate for
<IMG ALT="Magnitude of PSI" SRC="NBI-HISTORY/frm3.gif">
for "Tauchbahnen" and we obtained pretty nice results for Na
if I remember well. After the conference I wrote a manuscript --a fairly
clumsy one I fear-- which I sent to Goudsmit. I got it back, much
later but soon afterwards Fermi's manuscript "Ueber die magnetischen
Momente der Atomkerne" was received (18. Dec. 1929) by Zs. f&uuml;r
Physik and appeared (Z. f&uuml;r Physik 60, 320, 1930).</EM>
It was quite edifying to watch Casimir's eagerness in working out this
problem. One evening we, some of us went to see the pictures, and persuaded
him to join us. In those days, they showed one reel of film at the time,
and lit the room every time they changed reels; at each recurrence of the
light, we could see our friend bending over odd scraps of paper and hastily 
filling them with formulae. <BR>

Commenting on the decisive part of the unravelling of the spectral 
regularities had played in the development of atomic theory, and mentioning 
especially Goudsmit's virtuosity in this art, Bohr told us that the 
latter's talent for tracking hidden order in apparent capriciousness
was by no means limited to physics; he also exercised it on classifying
the types of representation of sacred scarabs by the ancient Egyptians. 
On Goudsmit's first visit to Copenhagen in 1926, Bohr had been with him
to see the collection of Egyptian sculpture at the Glyptotek; as he started
translating the Danish labels for Goudsmit's benefit, the latter quietly
told him it was not necessary, as he could read the inscribed hieroglyphs.
Bohr had a large stock of such pointed anecdotes, reflecting his warm 
interest in people, that he was never tired of telling in those 
conversation with the older and younger physicists clustered around him,
during which he freely expressed his thoughts on the prospects of current
research as well as the widest implications of science, and displayed the 
best of his wisdom and deep humanity. <P>

Bohr as a lecturer is a different matter. It is much glossed, but very 
little written about. Perhaps the only one who has put his view of it
in print so far is Larmor; ina speech (later published
<A NAME="backh3" HREF="#refh3">[3]</A>) at the Maxwell
celebration in Cambridge in 1931, he commented upon Maxwell's reputation
of being <EM>a poor lecturer</EM> and roundly added: <EM>So perhaps 
with our friend Bohr: he might want to instruct us about the correlations
of too many things at once ...</EM> I was sitting near Bohr when the 
speech was delivered; as this judgement was expressed, Bohr whispered to
me: <EM>Imagine, he thinks I am a poor lecturer!</EM> Bohr's lectures,
composed with tremendous labour, were indeed masterpieces of allusive 
evocation of a subtle dialectic; the trouble was that the audience was
usually unprepared to catch subtle allusions to conceptions and arguments
which were anyhow unfamiliar and hard to grasp. <BR>

I am not sure whether Bohr's introductory talk at the conference was
really worse than the average; perhaps he had not prepared it so
thoroughly, since the idea was to have quite informal discussions: no
programme had been set up in advance - Bohr took in turn each of the
participants aside and asked him what topic he wished to bring up. 
At any rate, here is the impression this talk has left in my memory, as 
I described  it (with some hindsight) in 1945: <EM>He had begun with a few
general considerations calculated, no doubt, to convey to the audience
the peculiar sensation of having the ground suddenly removed from 
under their feet, which is so effective in promoting receptiveness for 
complementary thinking. This preliminary result being readily achieved,
he had eagerly hastened to his main subject and stunned us all (except
Pauli) with the non-observability of the electron spin. I spent the 
afternoon with Heitler pondering on the scanty fragments of the hidden 
wisdom which we had been able to jot down in our note books</EM>. <BR>

It was comforting to hear from Klein, when I told him some time
ago of our failure to understand what Bohr meant by the impossibility 
of measuring the spin of the electron, that he had the same difficulty 
when Bohr first discussed the matter with him in the autumn of 1928.
Guided by the general correspondence idea, Bohr argued that such a 
purely quantal concept as the electron spin, vanishing from the 
theory in the classical limit, could not possibly be brought in direct
relation with classical quantities like angular momentum or magnetic 
moment. It was not immediately clear to Klein, however, how this 
correspondence argument could be reconciled with the Stern-Gerlach
effect, which clearly exhibited a contribution to the magnetic moment
of an atom from an electron bound in a 2S state; but what Bohr demonstrated
was precisely that with a free electron a Stern-Gerlach experiment could
not succeed, because the effect of the Lorentz force would inevitably
blur any Stern-Gerlach pattern. This is the point he ineffectually 
tried to make in his talk. Fortunately, Mott, during his stay at the
Institute, had been engaged in the problem of electron polarisation, and
in the paper <A NAME="backh4" HREF="#refh4">[4]</A>
in which he brilliantly showed how this property could
in principle be ascertained by a double scattering experiment, he gave a
very clear account of the whole situation. He finished writing this paper
shortly after the conference (it was sent off by Bohr on the 25th of
April) and we were thus soon able to appreciate at leisure the full 
force of Bohr's famous argument. <P>

The incorporation of the spin into the relativistic quantum theory of the
electron had not removed from this theory the riddle of the negative
energy states. Klein had just given a striking illustration of the acuteness
of the difficulty by showing that electrons impinging upon a sufficiently
high and steep potential wall would not only suffer reflexion, but that
a sizable fraction of them would penetrate through the wall and
undergo a transition to states of negative kinetic energy
<A NAME="backh5" HREF="#refh5">[5]</A>. At the
conference, he submitted, tentatively, a way to escape from this "paradox":
it amounted to treating the electrostatic potential as an operator whose
eigenvalues would have a finite higher limit. Jordan pointed out that in
order to eliminate the paradox, this highest potential value should be
of an order of magnitude quite within the range of observation; probably
it ought to be something like
<IMG ALT="2 m c**2" SRC="NBI-HISTORY/frm4.gif">
(<EM>m</EM> denoting the
electron mass). Potential differences of this magnitude are indeed
observed between thunderstorm clouds and the earth. <BR>

Jordan's remark caught Bohr's imagination: here was a possible test of
Klein's assumptions. The limiting potential would presumably entail a
limit to the stability of matter: if it did occur in a thunderstorm,
a bird flying in the region of highest potential would then be killed.
The discussion went on, to and fro, as various consequences of Klein's
formalism were either put forth in support of it or found to raise
difficulties. Bohr kept musing about the fate of the bird, to
Ehrenfest's boundless amusement. Whenever the discussion ebbed out
for a moment: <EM>Now, Bohr</EM>, he would ask with boyish mischief,
<EM>is the bird still alive?</EM> <BR>

When we gathered again after lunch, Klein declared that he was now convinced
that his proposal would not work and that he withdrew it. This was
probably the shortest lifespan ever meted out to any theory.
For all his apparent playfulness, Ehrenfest took very much to heart the
difficulties in which relativistic quantum theory seemed to be bogged. I
got an inkling of this the next day, when, much to my surprise, I was
told, shortly after the end of the session, that Bohr wanted me to come to
his house (which was adjacent to the Institute and now part of it). I
was ushered into his study, where I found him and Ehrenfest installed in
comfortable armchairs and, judging by their smiles, engaged in pleasant
conversation. <EM>Could you tell us,</EM> Ehrenfest asked me with his wonted
directness, <EM>why the relativistic Klein-Gordon theory is unacceptable?
- Because</EM>, I replied pedantically, <EM>the charge-current density
is not of definite sign. - Yes,</EM> said Ehrenfest,<EM> but could
you just give us an example in which this property leads to unphysical
consequences?</EM> I never felt so sheepish in my life. Ehrenfest turned to
Bohr: <EM>You see,</EM> he said, <EM>just as I told you!</EM> From this
remark I surmised with some relief, - and my guess was soon confirmed
by the ensuing conversation, - that they did not impute the fiasco to my
personal stupidity, but took it as an illustration of a widespread failing
of the young generation, prompt to uncritical acceptance of dogmatism.
Bohr intervened with a soothing pronouncement about how hard it was
to imagine how the behaviour of the electron could be described beyond the
limit where correspondence with the classical point-charge picture
afforded legitimate guidance; we must here be prepared for further
renouncement in the application of classical concepts. How often
were we to hear this warning in the following years, until the
discoveries of the neutron and the positive electron broke the spell! <BR>

In retrospect, one cannot help admiring the penetration and independence
of judgment revealed by Ehrenfest's iconoclastic questioning. And yet
(as I later learned from Bohr), he was at the same time turning his
searching criticism against himself: he realized that progress  in such
untried regions of thought and imagination as quantum theory had opened,
demanded adventurous minds, unhampered by the scruples and doubts that
assailed him; he imagined he was losing his grip on physics and - worse
still for one always ready to pour out a wealth of affection on the youth -
getting out of touch with the coming generation. Of this inner tension
there was no outward sign, however: to the last we saw him as cheerful,
witty and warmhearted as ever. <P>

Pauli, so far as I remember, was rather subdued, except on one spectacular
occasion. Heitler, by lecturing on the theory of homopolar bond,
unexpectedly excited his wrath: for, as it turned out, he had a strong
dislike to this theory. Hardly had Heitler finished, that Pauli moved to the
blackboard in a state of great agitation; pacing to and fro he angrily
started to voice his grievance, while Heitler sat down on a chair at the
edge of the Podium. <EM>At long distances,</EM> Pauli explained, <EM>the
theory is certainly wrong, since we have there the Van der Waals attraction;
at short distances, obviously, it is also entirely wrong.</EM> At this point
he had reached the end of the podium opposite to that where Heitler was
sitting. He turned round and was now walking towards him, threateningly
pointing in his direction the piece of chalk he was holding in his hand:
<EM> Un nun,</EM> he exclaimed, <EM>gibt es eine an den guten Glauben der
Physiker appellierende Aussage, die behauptet, dass diese N&auml;herung,
die falsch ist in grossen Abst&auml;nden und falsch in kleinen
Abst&auml;nden, trotzdem in einem Zwischengebiet qualitativ richtig sein
soll!</EM> He was now quite near to Heitler. The latter leaned back
suddenly, the back of the chair gave way with a great crash, and poor
Heitler tumbled backward (luckily without hurting himself too much).
Casimir, who also remembers the incident, notes that Gamow was the first
to shout: <EM>Pauli-effect!</EM> And as an afterthought he adds:
<EM>Sometimes I wonder whether Gamow had not done something to the
chair beforehand.</EM> <P>

I found Gamow as jolly as I had always known him in G&ouml;ttingen since
the first day I saw him appear at Born's institute and heard of his
surprising intention of applying quantum mechanics to alpha-radioactivity.
His direct approach to the problem was, of course, most congenial to Bohr,
who had supported him wholeheartedly when he had to counter Laue's doubts
about the lawfulness of the new type of solution he had introduced 
<A NAME="backh6" HREF="#refh6">[6]</A>. I was then too much indoctrinated
with G&ouml;ttingen lore not to side with Laue in this debate; the more so
as Born had just shown us how he wanted to treat the problem by a somewhat
hazardous, but very ingenious, extension of hortodox perturbation technique
<A NAME="backh7" HREF="#refh7">[7]</A>. When remonstrating with Gamow in
the library, I went so far as to express doubt whether Gamow wavefunctions,
with their infinite norm, could at all be regarded as solutions of a
Schr&ouml;dinger equation. Pauli happened to overhear this rather wild
statement: <EM>They are certainly solutions,</EM> he interjected, <EM>but
whether they are allowed in quantum mechanics, this is questionable.</EM>
Gamow looked at us with an expression of wonder in his face: <EM> But my
solution</EM>, he said, <EM>just represents a damped resonance process; the
exponential increase at large distances has a simple interpretation, and
after all I get the decay constant and an improved Geiger-Nuttall law.
What else do you want? -- Anyhow,</EM> Pauli concluded as he went away,
<EM>it was great fun to see the flood of papers your theory let loose.</EM>
<BR>

<EM>I don't understand what all this fuzz is about</EM>, Gamow continued,
<EM>It is just a solution of a partial differential equation, of the kind
we use in mechanics and elasticity. When I showed it to Bohr, he was at once
enthusiastic. I was so pleased and proud that I wanted to show him
something more. I had noticed that the Schr&ouml;dinger equation could
be written as a classical diffusion equation, - only with a purely imaginary
diffusion coefficient. Now, I had better kept that to myself: Bohr's
reaction to it was anything but enthusiastic ...</EM><P>

On Gamow's work, which ushered in nuclear physics, there was no debate.
Mott, however, presented his analysis of the scattering of alpha-particles
by helium <A NAME="backh8" HREF="#refh8">[8]</A>, which was received with
considerable interest. It was a beautifully simple case of an interference
effect arising from the identity of the interacting particles, the first
concrete example of the intervention of Bose statistics in an individual
process. It was also a good lesson in the correct interpretation of a
wave-function - an art then so new that Mott's argument was not accepted
without some resistance on the part of one or two participants. <BR>

Darwin was deeply interested in these problems of interpretation; he
did extremely helpful work discussing in great detail, with consummate 
mathematical skill in the best Cambridge tradition, a variety of idealized 
experimental devices illustrating typical features of quantum mechanics.
The one he submitted at the conference 
<A NAME="backh9" HREF="#refh9">[9]</A> was a rather complicated case of 
constructive interference of wave-packets producing <EM>spontaneously
the results which simple intuition would suggest could only be due to 
particles.</EM> The analysis was as brilliant as ever, but unfortunately
carried him away, at the end, onto splippery ground. He argued that the 
seat of an <EM>observation</EM> could be shifted from the physical 
receptor to the retina, and thence to <EM>somewhere in the brain,</EM>
where <EM>we are absolutely compelled to stop.</EM> Right up to the
brain the process is <EM>non-committal: it is only after our consciousness
has animated the proceedings that it is possible to infer back and describe 
what actually happened in the familiar language of particles.</EM> Thus,
we have a <EM>sub-world</EM> described by a wave-function, <EM>a dead
world, not involving definite events, but instead the potentiality for
all possible events. It becomes animated by our consciousness, which 
so to speak cuts sections of it when it makes observations.</EM><BR>

This remarkable anticipation of von Neumann's <EM>Schnitt</EM> conception
struck me as being quite beside the point. It cannot make any difference 
by how many eyes, or brains, a scintillation on a screen is observed,
and there is no reference in the formalism (then my only anchor!) than to
the particle producing scintillation: the structure of the eye or the brain,
or even that of the screen, is quite irrelevant. These were (as near as I 
can figure out after so many years) the confused thoughts that crossed my
mind as I listened to Darwin. What troubled me mightly, however, was
Bohr's failure to react to propositions which seemed to me so alien to the
ideas he had expressed in the Como lecture. I was so disturbed by what
I mistook for silent acquiescence that, mustering all my courage, I 
approached Bohr and cautiously started to voice my doubts. <EM>Oh!</EM>
he said, interrupting me, <EM>this was all nonsense!</EM> <BR>

Then he motioned me to a neighbouring room, which had been Hevesy's 
laboratory: it was lined with cupboards, behind whose glass doors one 
could see rows of flasks containing brilliantly coloured solutions
of rare-earth compounds. In the middle of the room there was a long
table, and I stood at one extremity of it. I cannot find better words
to tell what happened next than those I wrote in my previous article:
Bohr described around the table, "at a rather lively pace, a Keplerian 
ellipse of large excentricity, of which the place where I was standing 
was a focus. All the time, he was talking in a soft, low voice, explaining
to me the broad outlines of his philosophy. He walked with bent head and 
knit brows; from time to time he looked up at me and underlined some 
important point by a sober gesture. As he spoke, the words and the
sentences which I read before in his papers suddendly took life and
became loaded with meaning. It was one of the few solemn moments that
count in an existence, the revelation of a world of dazzling thought,
truly an initiation." Bohr was particularly well prepared to comment
on the problems Darwin had raised: he was just writing up (in a short 
essay <A NAME="backh10" HREF="#refh10">[10]</A> in honour of the 50th 
anniversary of Planck's doctorate) his reflexions on the complementary
aspects of psychical phenomena. As an example of the shift that can occur
in the separation between observing subject and object of observation,
he mentioned the case of a cane held in the hand: if it is held firmly,
it is an instrument extending the range of tactile perception of the 
subject, who feels it as a part of himself; if it is held loosely,
it ceases to serve as an instrument and becomes an object of observation.
He was quite excited about this effect. He insisted that I should try
with a pencil that was lying on the table, and he watched me intently 
during the operation, eager to catch on my face a sign of the joyous 
wonder I could not fail to experience. <P>

I have not too much to tell about the obligatory three-castle tour, with
a stop at Bohr's country house at Tisvilde, a long walk through the
wood to Brantebjerg and along the strand to the village. The more
enterprising displayed their sportive talents; Bohr was outstanding 
at ricochet throws of pebbies on the sea, but most spectacular was
Jordan's acrobatics (it was rumoured he had lately taken to jiu-jitsu).
I would rather recall an afternoon outing of a small group of us, 
among whom Ehrenfest, to Christianshavn, where Bohr wanted to show us
Our Saviour's church. We took the boat at Nyhavn and landed near the famous
church, with its queer outer staircase winding up along the steeple. 
I was thrilled of the thought of seeing this monument, about which 
I had read as a boy in Jules Verne's <EM>Voyage au centre de la terre.</EM>
From the landing place the steeple looked curiously flat; Ehrenfest had the
same impression: <EM>It looks as if it had an elliptic cross-section -
if this were possible,</EM> he said. One ascends to the steeple from inside
the church; one first arrives at a kind of platform, on which lies, 
idle and rusty, a huge clockwork dating, as we ascertained, from the 
time of Huygens, and Newton. Here was the real goal of the trip. 
Bohr exulted: <EM>This shows us what classical mechanics is about,</EM>
he exclaimed. <EM>Nobody that sees this can doubt that our measuring 
instruments must be big bodies!</EM> <BR>

Next time Jauch comes to Copenhagen, I must take him to Our Saviour's
church. <P>
