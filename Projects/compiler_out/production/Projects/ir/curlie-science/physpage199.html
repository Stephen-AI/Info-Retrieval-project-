<p class="j">
<a href="figures/einstein.png">Einstein</a>,
<a href="figures/heisenberg.jpg">Heisenberg</a>, and
<a href="figures/tipler.jpg">Tipler</a>, after equal invariant intervals in
purgatory, find themselves before the Throne of God.
</p>

<p class="j">
As a man, they exclaim, &ldquo;What did I do to merit an eternity down
(brrrrr) <em>there</em>&rdquo;?
</p>

<p class="j">
God thought for a moment; when you're omnipresent in spacetime there's
no need for haste.  He turned first to Einstein.
</p>

<p class="j">
&ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you showed your species My creation in its most
elegant form, law without Law.  Then, inflamed by wartime passion, you
urged the transformation of your discovery into a
<a href="../minerats/figures/us.gif">weapon of mass
destruction</a>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="j">
Einstein shuffled his feet and nodded subtly.  He resisted the
temptation to
<a href="figures/albert.jpg">stick his tongue out</a>.
God turned His omniscient Eyes
toward Heisenberg.
</p>

<p class="j">
&ldquo;Werner, you discovered that I <em>do</em> play dice, and you glimpsed that I
<em>have to</em> if anything interesting's going to happen&mdash;your last words
were, &lsquo;I will ask Him why there is turbulence&rsquo;.  I will answer you,
&lsquo;So there can be Heisenberg&rsquo;.  But you <em>stayed in Germany,</em> Werner!
You worked on a reactor for Hitler; you taught physics to
brown-shirted Nazi thugs.  You'll recall that my Son is Jewish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="j">
&ldquo;Frank, Frank, Frank,&rdquo; God continued, &ldquo;didn't you read
<a href="../etexts/www/Bible/Bible.html">my book</a>?  I
read <a href="tipler.html">yours</a>, you know.  Does the phrase
<a href="../etexts/www/Bible/Exodus.html#20:3">&lsquo;Thou
shalt have no other gods
before me&rsquo;</a> ring a bell?  How about
<a href="../etexts/www/Bible/Revelation.html#1:8">&lsquo;I
am the Alpha and the Omega, the
beginning and the ending&rsquo;</a>?  You not only wanted to have another God
before Me, you wanted to <em>be</em> Him.  And the money, Frank&hellip;do you know
how piddling an advance I got for the
<a href="../etexts/www/Bible/Bible.html">Bible</a>?
And you assumed
causality&mdash;<em>you</em> Frank!  You should know me better than that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="j">
Tipler, almost defiant, raised his head and fixed God with a cold
stare.  &ldquo;Why are there singularities in Your universe?&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="j">
&ldquo;Because there are things I don't want you to know,&rdquo; God responded
calmly.
</p>

<p class="j">
Heisenberg, his dying question answered, remained silent, pondering
the choices he'd made during his life on Earth.
</p>

<p class="j">
Einstein seized the moment, &ldquo;Look, Old One&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;physics is local.
You made it that way; I figured it out.  But <em>why</em> is there that
spooky action-at-a-distance nonlocality in quantum mechanics?&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="j">
God chuckled.  Even experiencing all of spacetime at once, such events
were rare.  &ldquo;Albert, your greatest talent has always been not finding
the right answer&mdash;anybody could do that&mdash;but asking the right
question.  Your generation learned physics assuming I was a great
watchmaker; you destroyed that notion, but most of you
died off before it became evident what I was.  I create abstract
systems from pure information, Albert.  I'm a <em>programmer</em>.
</p>

<p class="j">
&ldquo;Quantum nonlocality is a <em>bug</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="j">
God turned to Saint Peter.  &ldquo;Einstein and Heisenberg go to Heaven.
Send Tipler to the massive rotating cylinder to try again.  Next
case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="j">
God hated these Judgement Days; he couldn't wait (to the extent that's
possible for an omnipresent being) to get back to his craps game
with Wotan, Jove, and Shiva.  Saint Peter looked up from his infinite
scroll, &ldquo;Fourth Commandment: blasphemy&mdash;eternal damnation.  Send in
Lederman and Hawking&rdquo;.
</p>

<p class="j">
What <em>was it</em> about these physicists, God wondered, as they approached
the Throne.
