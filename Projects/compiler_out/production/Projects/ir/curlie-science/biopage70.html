<H1>Introduction to the "Slime Molds"</H1>
<P>
</center><P>
Long classified together in the Myxomycophyta as part of the
<a href=/fungi/fungi.html>Fungi</a>,
slime "molds" are now known to be quite unrelated to the fungi. There
are three main groups of slime molds, which do not form a clade.

<b>Plasmodial slime molds</b>, like <i>Physarum</i> shown here, are basically
enormous single cells with thousands of nuclei.  They are formed when
individual flagellated cells swarm together and fuse.  The result is one
large bag of cytoplasm with many diploid nuclei.  These "giant cells" have
been extremely useful in studies of cytoplasmic streaming (the movement
of cell contents) because it is possible to see this happening even under
relatively low magnification.  In addition, the large size of
the slime mold "cell" makes them easier to manipulate than most cells.
<P>
A second group, the <b>cellular slime molds</b>, spend most
of their lives as separate single-celled amoeboid protists,
but upon the release of
a chemical signal, the individual cells aggregate into a great swarm.
Cellular slime molds are thus of great interest to cell and developmental
biologists, because they provide a comparatively simple and easily
manipulated system for understanding how cells interact to generate
a multicellular organism. There are two groups of cellular slime molds, the
Dictyostelida and the Acrasida, which may not be closely related to
each other.
<P>
A third group, the <b>Labyrinthulomycota</b> or
<a href="/chromista/sagenista.html">slime nets</a>, are also
called "slime molds", but appear to be more closely related to the
<a href=/chromista/chromista.html>Chromista</a>,
and not relatives of the other "slime mold" groups.

What these three groups have in common is a
<a href=/glossary/gloss6/altergen.html>life cycle</a>
that superficially resembles that of the fungi. When conditions become
unfavorable, these slime molds form <b>sporangia</b> - clusters of
spores, often on the tips of stalks such as in the sporangium of a
<i>Physarum</i> shown at right.  Spores from the sporangia are
dispersed to new habitats, "germinate" into small amoebae, and the
life cycle begins again. Similarities in the life cycle do not, however,
imply close relationship, especially when one considers that certain
<a href=/bacteria/bacteria.html>bacteria</a>
(the myxobacteria) and even an unusual
<a href=/protista/ciliata.html>ciliate</a>
have very similar life cycles, aggregating to form spores on a sporangium.<P>
<P>
Slime molds have almost no fossil record, which is not surprising. Not
only do slime molds produce few resistant structures (except for spores,
 which are often overlooked or unidentifiable), but they live in moist
terrestrial habitats, such as on decaying wood or fresh cow dung, where
their potential for preservation is low. A few fossil slime molds
have been found in amber (Poinar and
<a href=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/bmw/bmw.html>Waggoner</a>, 1992).
