      was evident in the
    nineteenth century in the context of infectious disease (<a href="theorimm.htm#The role of Ehrlich">Click here</a>). These barriers are both external
    (e.g. hygiene), and internal (e.g. the immune response). Internally, our bodies (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">self</font>&quot;) can detect and destroy members of other species (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">not-self</font>&quot;; i.e. viruses, bacteria, protozoa).</font></p>
    <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another, no less
    subtle form of self/not-self discrimination, involves our detection of a mate (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">near-self</font>&quot;) who will be our &quot;<font color="#0000A0">physiological
    complement</font>&quot; such that the union will produce healthy offspring (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">hybrids</font>&quot;). An incestuous relationship with a close relative
    (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">too near-self</font>&quot;) will probably result in less
    healthy offspring. On the other hand, extreme out-breeding, such as with an ape
    (<font color="#0000A0">not-self</font>), is prohibited by species barriers.</font></p>
    <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is more to this
    than just the inability to copulate (the gamete transfer barrier). There are both
    <em><b><font color="#0080C0">external</font></b></em> components (e.g. mate choice), and
    <em><b><font color="#0080C0">internal</font></b></em> components. Even if the male sperm could meet and
    fuse with the female ovum, the resulting cell (&quot;zygote&quot;)
    might be unable to grow from embryo to an adult organism (developmental barrier resulting in &quot;<font color="#0000A0">hybrid inviability</font>&quot;). Even if these transfer and developmental
    barriers were overcome, in the gonad (testes, ovary) the two sets of parental chromosomes
    might be unable to pair for gamete-production (gonadal barrier resulting in &quot;<font color="#0000A0">hybrid sterility</font>&quot;). Our modern understanding of these barriers
    began with Charles Darwin's <strong><font color="#804040"><i>The Origin of Species </i></font></strong>(1859).</font></p>

        protege and
      for the annual Romanes Lecture series he endowed at Oxford. However, Darwin's mantle
      had been safely entrusted. Four years after Darwin's death Romanes published an
      extraordinary paper in the <i><strong><font color="#804040">Journal of the Linnean Society</font></strong>,</i>
      entitled &quot;Physiological Selection: An Additional Suggestion on the Origin of
      Species&quot;<sup>12</sup>. In a formidable display of deductive reasoning, paralleled
      only by that of Darwin himself, Romanes resolved the three major problems in Darwin's
      theory -- &quot;<font color="#0000A0">inutility of characters</font>&quot;, &quot;<font color="#0000A0">blending inheritance</font>&quot;, and &quot;<font color="#0000A0">hybrid

      these observations to natural species. Yet he was aware (and the biologist Thomas Huxley
      constantly reminded him) that, if crosses between members of closely related natural
      species were possible, the &quot;hybrid&quot; offspring were
      invariably <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>sterile</i></strong></font>. If we consider
      the horse and the ass as members of separate natural species, when a cross is made between

      and cannot reproduce.</font></p>

      <i>fertile</i></strong></font>. If one defines a species as a group of organisms which do
      not breed (produce fertile offspring) with members of other species (e.g. cats do not
      breed with dogs), then &quot;species&quot; arising under
      domestication (e.g. poodle and bulldog) are not true species even though they may differ
      greatly from each other anatomically; they are &quot;varieties&quot;,

      He suggested that, like cells of all other organs and tissues, germ line cells might
      undergo random variations. Variations, for example, in height or eye colour were familiar
      to everyone. No one knew what caused variations, but no one doubted their existence.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="6">R</font><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">omanes
      emphasized one possible class of variation affecting germ line cells, which would make an
      organism less fertile with other members of the species but not influence somatic
      characters. Normally the loss of fertility would be highly disadvantageous because the
      organism would leave no offspring. However, he further argued that if two organisms
      underwent the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>same</i></strong></font> type of variation,
      they would still be fertile <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>between themselves</i></strong></font>.
      They would be &quot;<font color="#0000A0">physiological complements</font>&quot;. Hence,
      at any time-point a species would consist of the parental group (comprising the majority
      of species members), and numerous small variant groups. Members of each variant group
      would be less fertile with members of the parental group and of the other variant groups.
      Members of each group, to varying degrees, would be &quot;<font color="#0000A0">reproductively
      isolated</font>&quot; from members of the other groups, but remain quite fertile with each
      other. Hybrid sterility would be an extreme manifestation of the phenomenon.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romanes demonstrated
      that irrespective of any selective
      factors in the environment (no &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;
      required), members of the reproductively variant groups would tend also to be somatically
      variant, just as members of the parental group would tend to be somatically variant (e.g.
      changes in height or muscular strength). In the absence of environmental selection,
      however, somatic variations of members of the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>large</i></strong></font>
      parental group would not be sustained, because these members were crossing freely with
      each other, a process which tended to blend and neutralize variations. For example,
      although humans vary in height, tall people cross with small people and the average height
      tends to remain constant.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand,
      variations within a <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>small</i></strong></font> variant
      group would not be subjected to this &quot;swamping&quot;
      effect due to blending with members of the parental group (i.e. there would be less
      non-variants to dilute the variation). Because of this reproductive isolation, the
      variation would be sustained. If, by chance, the variation happened to confer some
      advantage to members of the variant group, relative to members of the parental group, that
      would be a bonus. The selective advantage conferred would allow the commencement
      of classical Darwinian natural selection.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major difference
      between the old Darwinian formulation (natural selection), and the new Romanesian
      formulation (physiological selection) was that in the first case, natural selection
      preceded reproductive isolation, where in the second case reproductive isolation preceded
      natural selection (Figure 2). Reproductive isolation, in any shape or form, would suffice,
      but the most usual form of isolation would result from physiological selection. Of course
      in a large population it would be very unlikely that a male and a female whose gonads had
      undergone the same rare variation would encounter each other. Thus the variation would
      probably not be perpetuated. Indeed, as Romanes pointed out, successful speciation was
      rare.</font></td>

      Bateson's career the overwhelming importance of the phenomenon of hybrid sterility dawned
      on him, and he began to consider its possible causes. In 1913 Bateson dismissed sterility
      associated with certain anther variants in plants as being due to a &quot;simple recessive character,&quot; implying that sterility due to
      defects in one or a few defined characters was unlikely to be of general significance for the evolution of species.<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;

      chromosomes carrying genes contributed by the mother pair, on a one-to-one basis, with the
      complementary set of chromosomes carrying the genes contributed by the father. Close
      identity is essential for this pairing, which is required so that subsequent cell division
      and multiplication can proceed, resulting in the formation of gametes (sperms and ova). In
      hybrid sterility the pairing is defective and a degenerate gonad results. Thus the
      question of the origin of species becomes a question of the origin of hybrid sterility,
      which, in turn, leads to the question of the nature of the chromosomal <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>incompatibilities</i></font></strong> which prevent pairing, or
      conversely, the nature of the chromosomal <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>compatibilities</i></font></strong>

      factors&quot; were components of the reproductive systems which were <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>incompatible</i></font></strong>, thus preventing the production of

      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That hybrid sterility
      was strictly the result of a failure of the pairing of complementary chromosomes was
      brought home forcefully by experiments showing that hybrid sterility could be &quot;cured&quot; in certain organisms by artificially doubling the
      number of chromosomes. This was because each chromosome now had a partner with which it
      could pair (i.e. chromosomes from the mother could pair with each other, and chromosomes
      from the father could pair with each other). If the sterility had been due to a defect in
      particular genes, this &quot;<font color="#0000A0">cure</font>&quot; would be unlikely<sup>33</sup>.</font></p>

      <p <p align="justify"><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">n 1976 Richard Dawkin's <strong><font color="#804040"><i>The Selfish Gene</i></font></strong>, which magnificently synthesized
      the work of William Hamilton and George Williams, added a fresh perspective to Darwinian
      ideas.<sup>39-41</sup> However, the new viewpoint was largely biological, and many
      inconsistencies remained. Then in the 1990s came the genome project and a deluge of DNA
      sequence data from biochemical laboratories. The first results of the bioinformatic
      analysis of these data have suddenly given the story fresh impetus. It appears that the
      chromosomal incompatibility which allows species to originate either arises from &quot;<font color="#0000A0">macromutations</font>&quot; which affect chromosome segments<sup>31, 33</sup>,
      or is the <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>cumulative</i></font></strong> result of
      numerous &quot;<font color="#0000A0">micromutations</font>,&quot; as proposed by the
      present author in 1996<sup>42</sup>. In either case, Romanes was right as he did not
      specify the nature of the &quot;<font color="#000000">peculiarity of the reproductive
      system</font>&quot; which would lead to reproductive isolation.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strength of the
      micromutation proposal is that it allows fine degrees of compatibility, so that a rare
      reproductive variant would be more likely to find a partially matching physiological
      complement. The proposal arose from the perception that DNA, the molecule in chromosomes
      which transmits hereditary information, has <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>two levels</i></font></strong>
      of information. There is nothing strange about this. A radio operator has to decide what
      message to transmit, and on what wavelength to transmit it. Thus the radio signal contains
      primary information (the message) and secondary information (the wavelength). The message
      is basically the same whatever wavelength is employed. The role of the secondary
      information is to allow discrimination between messages; it allows the receiver to tune
      out unwanted messages.</font></p>

      the <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>primary</i></font></strong> information that Mary
      possessed an immature, white, sheep. In class-conscious England at the beginning of the
      20th century, however, the sentences would also have communicated the <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>secondary</i></font></strong> information that Eliza was of &quot;<font color="#000000">lower class</font>&quot; cockney origin, whereas Freddy was of &quot;<font color="#000000">middle class</font>&quot; origin. </font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may regard Eliza's
      dropped <strong>H</strong>s as micromutations. The secondary information, because of such
      micromutations, constitutes a &quot;<font color="#0000A0">reproductive barrier</font>&quot;.
      Cockneys tend to marry cockneys and perpetuate cockney secondary information. The middle
      class tend to marry into the middle class and perpetuate middle class secondary
      information. Thus, Eliza appeared to be reproductively isolated from Freddy largely
      because of her language. Although, perhaps with some difficulty, both could understand
      each other's primary information, the secondary information (Eliza's dropped <strong>H</strong>s)
      seemed to constitute a barrier. </font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaw tells us that
      Professor Higgins performed the appropriate experiment. He demonstrated that if the
      linguistic barrier were removed, then the reproductive barrier would also be removed.
      Eliza and Freddy lived happily-ever-after. We can say that they then possessed &quot;<font color="#000000">linguistic complements</font>&quot;, by which we mean that they approached
      linguistic identity. Alternatively, we can say that until Professor Higgins had performed
      his magic, their reciprocal differences, or &quot;<font color="#000000">complementary
      factors</font>&quot; (Eliza's dropped <strong>H</strong>s, and Freddy's included <strong>H</strong>s)
      kept them reproductively isolated. </font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to
      note that Eliza's cockney accent was a global characteristic of her speech. Each sentence
      she spoke was influenced by it. While each sentence provided a <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>discrete</i></strong></font>
      piece of &quot;<font color="#0000A0">primary</font>&quot; information, which was localized
      <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>in that sentence</i></strong></font>, the &quot;<font color="#0000A0">secondary&quot;</font> information (her accent) was diffused across all
      sentences. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also note
      that once the marriage knot had been tied (i.e. the barrier to reproduction formally
      removed), a good chance existed that, even if her accent subsequently regressed (diverged
      from Freddy's, so that linguistic complementarity was lost), the marriage (reproduction)
      would continue. Thus the <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>initial</i></font></strong>
      secondary information (a reproductive barrier) needed only to be removed <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>temporarily</i></font></strong> until a more substantial (legal) way of
      removing the barrier had been substituted.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arrus BT" size="5">This latter point
      proves of considerable importance when we move back to the problem of gaining evidence for
      two levels of information in DNA. Whatever the <font color="#000000">initial</font>
      isolation process which led to the divergence between ancestral lines leading to, say, the
      modern elephant and mouse, it is clear that there is now a more substantial barrier to
      reproduction between the two (a gamete transfer barrier). It would probably be fruitless
      to examine these species for molecular clues as to the way the initial divergence took
      place (Figure 3). In virus species, however, signs of the initial isolation process might
      still exist. This, indeed, seems to be the case with viruses with the potential to coexist
      in the same host cell<sup><span class="auto-style5">42</span></sup>.</font></td>

              forms part of a small block in William Street, Kingston. Shortly after the move we found
              that in the 1840s the block had housed Queen's College (see</font> <font color="#804040" face="Dutch 801 Roman" size="3"><strong><i>Queen's: The First Hundred and Fifty Years</i></strong></font>

          1890, Walter Heape (1855-1928) successfully transferred rabbit embryos
          from one mother to another, thus performing what we believe was the
          first mammalian embryo transfer. He thus achieved what Romanes had
          attempted but failed to do; namely, to demonstrate that, at least
          during the period of embryogenesis, the postulated &quot;<font color="#0000A0">gemmules</font>&quot;
          or &quot;<font color="#0000A0">pangens</font>&quot; of genetic
          information postulated by Darwin, could <u> not</u> be transferred from the
          mother to the foetus. The new born rabbits had all the characters of
          the biological parent. However, while Heape asked &quot;<font color="#0000A0">What
          effect, if any, does a uterine foster-mother have upon her
          foster-children?</font>&quot;, he made no claim to be testing Darwin's
          hypothesis of pangenesis.</font></p>
          <p <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biggers (1991) suggests
          that &quot;<font color="#0000A0">Romanes abandoned his ovarian
          transplantation and embryo transfer studies when he became convinced,
          somewhat surprisingly, that, when two breeds of rabbit hybridize, no
          intermediate between the two parental forms are produced.</font>&quot;
          In theory, at least some of Darwin's &quot;<font color="#0000A0">gemmules</font>&quot;
          should have transferred between the two parental genomes to produce
          intermediate types. Thus, in his own way, Romanes had rediscovered
          some of what Naudin and Mendel had discovered in the 1860s.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romanes did not easily give
          up on the possibility of &quot;<font color="#0000A0">gemmule</font>&quot;
          transfer, which might explain the acquisition of acquired properties (Lamarkism).
          Shortly before his premature death in 1894 he wrote to Sharpey-Schafer
          (May 18th) who had reported some success in transfer experiments:</font></p>

                  several years experimenting with rats, rabbits and [&nbsp; ],
                  that one may breed scores and hundreds of first crosses
                  between different varieties, and never get a single mongrel
                  throwing off intermediate characters - or indeed any
                  resemblance to one side of the house. Yet, if the younger are
                  subsequently crossed inter se (i.e. brothers and sisters, of
                  first crossings) the crossed parentage at once repeats itself.
                  Ergo, even if the pups wh. are born appear to give a negative
                  result, keep them to breed from with one another.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p></td>

          crosses in 1865.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much like Romanes, Walter Heape was independently
          wealthy and was educated by a private tutor. He was interested in the
          application of scientific knowledge to human welfare, but appreciated
          how inadequate was the knowledge base. He supervised the construction
          of the Plymouth Laboratory under the auspices of the Marine Biological
          Association to serve the fishing industry. At Cambridge, he was a
          student of Foster, and here he probably first encountered William
          Bateson. At a critical point, he was appointed to the Evolution
          Committee of the Royal Society of London. Here, the knives were out
          between Bateson and the &quot;<font color="#0000A0">Biometricians</font>&quot; (including Weldon).
          The Committee ended in backing Bateson. Heape's work was confirmed by
          Castle &amp; Phillips (1909) with guinea pigs.</font></p>

          A related issue was whether prior fertilization by one male could be
          evident in the offspring of fertilization by another male (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">telogony</font>&quot;).
          Thus, a woman might have, by a second husband, children who resembled
          a former husband. The &quot;<font color="#0000A0">gemmules</font>&quot;
          of the ex-husband would have persisted long enough to influence
          later children (a handy excuse for a randy ex). This was investigated by another member of the
          Evolution Committee, J. Cossar Ewart (1851-1933),
          who had collaborated in research with Romanes in Scotland in the
          1870s, and had been supported by Romanes in seeking (and obtaining)
          the Chair of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh. He
          prompted Lord Rosebery to sponsor a series of lectures by Romanes in
          1888 on &quot;<font color="#0000A0">The Philosophy of Natural History</font>,&quot;

      event</strong></i></u></font>. </font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4">Evolution
      results from the accumulation of many evolutionary &quot;events&quot;, each involving some
      or all of four processes: <u>variation</u>, <u>heredity</u> (inheritance), <u>phenotypic
      selection</u>, <u>reproductive isolation</u>. An evolutionary event begins with variation
      and is followed by the process of heredity continuing through the generations.
    Differential selection
      may follow variation. </font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><font color="#004080"><u><strong><i>Variation</i></strong></u></font><font color="#804040"> 
	  (like does not produce like). There is variation among members of a biological species
      and the resulting variant members are candidates for
      differential selection. Variation
      is a </font><font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>process</i></strong></font><font color="#804040"> which produces the variant features of variant organisms. These variant
      features are themselves often referred to as variations. Thus the word &quot;</font><font color="#0000A0">variation</font></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4">&quot;
      must be understood in context either as the <i>process</i>, or as the <i> result</i> of that process.
      Some variant features are latent or cryptic (i.e. not immediately observable). </font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font color="#004080" face="Arrus BT" size="4"><u><i><strong>Heredity</strong></i></u></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4"> (like produces like). There is inheritance of a
      newly acquired variation by at least some of the offspring of variant members, and
      inheritance of that variation, in turn, by some of their offspring, and some of the
      subsequent offspring. If a variation is not inherited (overtly or cryptically) then it may
      be the result of some environmental influence and is not strictly related to the
      evolutionary event under consideration. Thus, increased muscular strength 
	  acquired through exercise would not be transferred to offspring. </font></p>

	  &nbsp;<font color="#004080" face="Arrus BT" size="4"><u><i><strong>Blending 
	  inheritance</strong></i></u></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4"> 
	  (like and non-like merge). Recombination being a rare and random 
	  event, each gene tends to be inherited intact and a corresponding 
	  character may emerge unblended with other characters. Thus, the major factor 
	  determining tallness in peas is stem-length, which is controlled by one 
	  gene. The tall character is inherited without blending. The individual pea 
	  plant is either tall or short. There are no intermediates. However, often 
	  dominance is incomplete, so a blended phenotype appears among offspring. 
	  Thus, all the offspring of a cross between red and white flowering plants 
	  may all be pink in the first generation. Furthermore, numerous characters are multigenic 
	  (non-allelic). Thus, tallness in man 
	  depends on the lengths of many individual bones. It was recognized by 
	  Mendel, Bateson and, later, Fisher, that multigenic characters will blend 
	  in offspring (i.e. a range of intermediates will be observed). Thus, the 
	  extent of phenotypic variation offered to natural selection 
	  will be decreased relative to non-blending inheritance. Blending inheritance will tend to slow the rate of 
	  evolutionary change.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></font></p>

      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><font color="#004080"><u><i><strong>Selection</strong></i></u></font>.
      The words &quot;<font color="#0000A0">selection</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color="#0000A0">isolation</font>&quot; have led to confusion. The words have the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>same</i></strong></font> meaning, although one may be preferred
      in a particular context. Selection is something which can be done when there is more than
      one of something. If there is only one of something, then it can be
      considered as <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>already</i></strong></font>
      selected (or isolated). In much of the literature, &quot;<font color="#0000A0">selection</font>&quot;
      often means phenotypic selection; &quot;<font color="#0000A0">isolation</font>&quot;
      often means reproductive selection.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><font color="#004080"><u><i><strong>Phenotypic
      selection </strong></i></u></font>There is positive selection of
      members of the species with advantageous variations, and negative selection of members of
      the species with disadvantageous variations. This isolation on the basis of phenotypic
      adaptations (positive or negative) is the type of selection with which Darwin was
      primarily concerned. In this respect he and others spoke of &quot;survival of the
      fittest&quot; and the &quot;</font></font><font face="Arrus BT" size="4" color="#950000">struggle for existence</font><font color="#804040"><font size="4">&quot;. He used the term &quot;<font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>natural</i></strong>
      selection</font>&quot; to distinguish this form of phenotypic
      selection from the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>artificial</i></strong></font> selection carried out by the
      horticulturalist or breeder. However, reproductive
      isolation/selection can <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>also</i></strong></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4"> be natural or artificial. </font></font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><i><u><font color="#004080"><strong>Reproductive
      isolation</strong></font></u></i>. Variation, heredity and
      phenotypic selection can operate so that advantageous phenotypic characteristics
      tend to increase in a population, and disadvantageous phenotypic characteristics
      tend to decrease in a population. They provide for the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>adaptation</i></strong></font> of species, and operate primarily at the level of the individual member
      of the species (individual selection). Ultimately, this linear process
      (isolation of the fit from the unfit) can
      lead to new species (i.e. one that would have been reproductively 
	  incompatible with the ancestral species if the cross were still possible). Here the fit are
	  <font face="Arrus BT" size="4" color="#804040"> <i><font color="#0000A0"><strong>reproductively isolated </strong></font></i></font>
	  from the unfit, because the latter are eliminated. However, sometimes an 
	  origin of species arises from a divergence&nbsp; 
	  between two equally fit populations, and <i><font color="#0000A0"><strong>reproductive isolation</strong></font></i>
      is needed more directly. To originate species in this way (isolation of the fit from the
      fit) <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>groups</i></strong></font> have to be selected. Speciation
      (species selection) is a form of <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>group
      selection</i></strong></font></font></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4">.
      A group is a set of units. For our purposes, if there is only one unit in a set it is an
      individual, and does not constitute a group. A group whose members reproduce only
      asexually is, by definition, already reproductively isolated from other groups. </font><font color="#804040"></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><u><i><font color="#004080"><strong>Species
      </strong></font></i></u>. The most secure definition of a biological
      species is a group of organisms which is <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>reproductively
      isolated</i></strong></font></font></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4">
      from other groups of organisms. Members of the group are unable to cross
      (continue the line) with all
      other organisms except those organisms which belong to the group.
      Inability to cross includes the production of offspring that are sterile
      (infertile). Degrees of infertility
      are characteristic of organisms at the species interface (i.e. potential incipient
      species).</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><u><i><font color="#004080"><strong>Hybrid</strong></font></i></u><font color="#804040">. The offspring of crosses between members of two anatomically distinct
      lines (varieties, races) are often referred to as &quot;hybrids&quot;. Since the
      definition of species is based primarily on reproductive performance, rather than
      anatomical difference, this can lead to confusion. For our purposes </font><font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>any</i></strong></font><font color="#804040"> offspring is the
      hybrid of its parents if the parents are different genomically. There may
      be hybrid vigour
      (&quot;positive heterosis&quot;). There may be &quot;negative
      heterosis&quot; manifest as </font><font color="#004080"><em><strong>hybrid
      inviability</strong></em></font><font color="#804040"> (developmental barrier) or </font><font color="#004080"><em><strong>hybrid sterility</strong></em></font><font color="#804040">
      (gonadal barrier). For humans, the only possible offspring not a &quot;hybrid&quot; would
      be the extremely improbable case of a female who inherited absolutely identical sequences
      from both parents. In the case of a human male, even if the autosomes were absolutely
      identical, the sex chromosomes would differ; so, under our definition, all males are
      hybrids.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

      </font><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><font color="#804040">
      More usually, the term is used in the context of a specific character
      (e.g. height). An organism may be pure (homozygous) for that character
      (e.g. corresponding paternal and maternal chromosomes both contain a gene
      conferring tallness), or it may be a hybrid for that character (e.g. the paternal
      chromosome may contain a gene conferring tallness and the maternal
      chromosome may contain a gene conferring smallness). If tallness is
      dominant, then the hybrid (heterozygote) may be as tall as organisms which
      are homozygously tall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font color="#004080"><strong><em><u>Genome</u></em></strong></font><font color="#804040">.
      This term might be interpreted by the uninitiated as &quot;gene
      home&quot;. We talk of &quot;the human genome&quot; or &quot;the genome of the bacterium <em>Escherichia
      coli</em>&quot;. We usually mean the most obvious form of genetic material, which in these
      organisms is DNA. It is true that most of the <em>E. coli</em> genome consists of genes,
      but in &quot;higher&quot; organisms there is much DNA which is not so obviously
      &quot;genic&quot;. Our genomes are not just &quot;gene homes&quot;. Note also that a piece
      of the genome which we recognize as a &quot;gene&quot; may be serving functions other than
      those conventionally considered &quot;genic&quot;. This is considered more in the
      Bioinformatics/Genomics section of these pages.</font><font color="#804040" face="Dutch 801 Roman" size="3"></p>
