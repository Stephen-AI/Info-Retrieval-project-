The following pages are dedicated to English words that can be spelled using 
chemical symbols. These lists are good through 5/30/12, and include all elements 
through element 112 (Copernicium, Cn), plus 114 (Flerovium, Fl) and 116 (Livermorium, Lv). 
I know these pages are rather bare-bones, but I wanted folks just to be able to 
see the words and get on with things.</h3>

<h3>
Who might be interested in this page? Anyone who loves chemistry, certainly. 
High school teachers could use these words to increase the interest in the 
subject. How about English lovers who want ONe SUPEr ScHoLaSTiC PrOCeSS ThAt 
He/SHe CaN USe In ClAsS?&nbsp; Or what about chemistry teachers trying to help 
student learn their chemical symbols (Question:&nbsp; Picasso pioneered what 
short-lived but influential form of art?&nbsp; Answer: Copper + Bismuth + 
Samarium = CuBiSm).</h3>

<h3><a name="Names"></a>7.&nbsp; A list of first names (741 of them) that can be

total of 4765 distinct names were thus considered), according to the Social 
Security Administration.&nbsp; [<a href="nameslist.htm">list</a>]</h3>

<h3><a name="Countries"></a>8.&nbsp; A list of countries (34 of them) that can

countries that have been accepted by the United Nations, so for instance KOsOVO

not been considered.&nbsp; [<a href="countrieslist.htm">list</a>]</h3>

<a name="Factoids"></a>Interesting Facts:&nbsp; </h2>
<h3>
The addition in May 2012 of Fl and Lv added 381 new words, with 955 total new spellings.  
While no new countries were added to the list, there were 7 new names (with a total of 10 new spellings).  Also,
the atomic element Silver was added, bringing the total number of elements that can be spelled to 13 (see below).
</h3>
<h3>
The longest word you can spell with chemical symbols is 
&quot;nonrepresentationalisms,&quot; which can be spelled four different ways with 
symbols, one of which is &quot;NoNRePReSeNTaTiONaLiSmS.&quot;&nbsp; There is a tie for 
longest words if only unique chemical symbols may be used:&nbsp; 
&quot;hypercoagulabilities&quot; and &quot;hyperconsciousnesses&quot; (&quot;HYPErCoAgULaBiLiTiEs&quot; and 
&quot;HYPErCoNScIOUSnEsSeS&quot;).&nbsp; The first word alphabetically is &quot;acacias&quot; 
(&quot;AcAcIAs&quot;), a type of shrub, and the last word alphabetically is &quot;ywis&quot; 
(&quot;YWIS&quot;), a Middle-English way of saying &quot;certainly.&quot; </h3>
<h3>There are two words tied for having the largest number of different 
spellings with symbols:&nbsp; each of &quot;innocuousnesses&quot; and 
&quot;inconspicuousnesses&quot; can be spelled in 48 different ways.&nbsp; Similarly, 
there are two words tied for having the largest number of different spellings 
using distinct symbols:&nbsp; each of &quot;pocosin&quot; and &quot;inosculate&quot; can be spelled 
13 different ways with distinct symbols.&nbsp; Interestingly, those 13 spellings 
of &quot;inosculate&quot; are the only 13 possible spellings to begin with for that word.</h3>

<h3>
Note that the only elements that require the use of repeated chemical symbols 
are copper and phosphorus.&nbsp; And that arsenic, copper, iron, silver, and tin cannot be 
spelled with their own chemical symbols.</h3>

<h3>

<a name="Explanations"></a>I should note that I am using the ENABLE dictionary 
as my source for English words. ENABLE is essentially based on the concept that 
if you can use it in Scrabble, you can find it in their dictionary. Plus, you 
can find words longer than 8-9 letters long. Essentially, ENABLE is based on 
Merriam Webster's 10th edition and it is the gold-standard of word puzzle makers 
and solvers everywhere. <br><br>
Some simple examples of what is (and is not) in ENABLE:&nbsp; words that must be 
capitalized, like &quot;Ireland,&quot; are not allowed, and neither are acronyms, like 
&quot;N.R.A.,&quot; unless they have come into the vernacular as words, such as &quot;laser.&quot; 
Archaic words, like &quot;thir&quot; (a Middle-English pronoun) are allowed, as are 
abbreviations that have become full-fledged words in their own right, such as 
&quot;repo.&quot; Those two words, spelled with chemical symbols, are ThIr and either RePO 
or RePo, by the way.&nbsp; Now, there ARE words that are not on the ENABLE word 
list, though I don't know why:&nbsp; for instance, &quot;inasmuch&quot; (INaSmUCH) is 
absent.&nbsp; To keep the list organized and regulated, though, I decided to 
keep all of the words in ENABLE in the normal lists, alphabetized; those words 
not in ENABLE come after the main lists.&nbsp; If you find any words that are 
not in the lists (so far I have but two), please let me know!&nbsp; Also, 
clearly, as new element names and symbols become official, and as new words are 
added to the English language, these lists will change.</h3>
