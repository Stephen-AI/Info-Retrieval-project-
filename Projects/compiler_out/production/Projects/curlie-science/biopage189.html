<h2 align=center>The Setting</h2>        
<HR>

Cape Canaveral, FL (AP) - With the new evidence of Life on Mars (tm)
demonstrated by tiny microbes embedded in a meteorite, NASA has made some
last minute crew additions on its first manned mission to Mars.  <p>

NASA officials have decided that the mission's priority is the discovery
of any life on the red planet.  Due to the limited amount of testing that
can be done during the mission itself, the mission plans to capture any
lifeforms that are found, and to return them back to Earth for further
study.<p>

The last minute crew changes reflect this philosophy, and have boosted
many experts' evaluations of the success of this mission.  The first
two new members are noted wildlife expert Marlin Perkins and his
assistant, Jim Fowler, both known best from <i>Mutual of Omaha's Wild
Kingdom (tm)</i>. These animal biologists have earned a first rate
reputation from their experience in Africa.<p>

The second two new crew members add an international flair to the mission. 
Jacques-Yves Cousteau and his son/assistant Phillippe, noted experts in
marine biology and strange oceanic life forms, will also be onboard to try
and collect specimens for future analysis.<p>

There is an intense competitive rivalry between the two groups, which NASA
hopes will motivate the mission specialists to perform at their best. 
Vegas oddsmakers are already taking bets as to who will succeed in
capturing alien life first.<p>

So Brian, will Marlin or Jacques be the first to bag an alien? <p>

<H1 align=center>Jacques-Yves Cousteau</H1>
<H3 align=center>vs.</H3>
<H1 align=center>Marlin Perkins</H1>

<HR>
<H2 align=center>The Commentary</H2>
<HR>



<B>BRIAN:</B> Marlin is so all over this I'm not sure why Jacques is even
bothering to tag along.  First of all, last time I checked, there are no
oceans on Mars.  True, Marlin and Jim won't be right at home in the
deserts of the red planet, but that terrain is a heck of a lot more like
the African Serengheti (tm) then the middle of the South Pacific.  While
Cousteau is stuck in a dry canyon, wondering why the Calypso II won't go
anywhere, Marlin and Jim are already halfway up Olympus Mons in their
custom Range Rover (tm). <P>

But more important than this is the simple fact that Cousteau is french. 
When's the last time the French did anything technologically significant? 
Other than Pasteurization (tm), what have they given the world aside from
fine wine and a place to park your military for a few years?  Their
scientific ineptitude has been further demonstrated recently by their
decision to start nuclear testing once again.  Anyone who feels that they
still need to prove that nuclear weapons are destructive is obviously too
stupid to be allowed to play with them.  So in an effort to re-invent the
wheel, a nation led by an obscure Warner Brothers (tm) cartoon character
decides to alienate the entire world.  I think "morons" is too kind a
word here. <P>

Perkins, on the other hand, is American.  In the spirit of Neil Armstrong,
Charles Lindburg, and Arvydas Sabonis, he is a true Trail Blazer (tm). <P>

Oh, there is one other thing that the French are known for, but that could
also seriously hurt Cousteau's chances.  In the event that the first
life-form encountered is Sharon Stone or one of those three-breasted
women, I don't think Cousteau would be too quick to report it, if you know
what I mean.  Meanwhile, Marlin can find some suitable muppet looking
fuzzball and be on the front page of every paper on Earth. <P>

<B>STEVE:</B> Marlin is so far out of his league in this one that's it's
not even funny.  If it doesn't have four legs, he won't know what it is. 
All you ever see him catch are lions, tigers, elephants, and zebras.  He's
a one-trick pony, and his trick isn't likely to be found on Mars.  Marlin
and Jim will probably spend their time joyriding on the Martian surface in
their land rover with a hunting rifle looking for big game.  Of course,
they're not going to find any.  Cousteau on the other hand, recognizes
bizarre lifeforms all the time, which is exactly what one would expect to
find in this situation.  "Et voila! A featureless blob! Parfait!"  It'll
probably take him all of 5 minutes to find something. <p>

Another important factor is the Martian atmosphere.  Last time that I
checked (this was pre-<i>Total Recall</i>), you're going to need a
spacesuit to breathe on Mars.  Cousteau is a natural for working in this
environment.  He's used to Scuba gear, and diving bells, etc.  But
Marlin's idea of breathing equipment is a medicated inhaler to help
his emphysema from years of smoking. <p>

Finally, have you noticed that Jacques sun-wrinkled physique looks
remarkably like the martians from <i>Mars Attacks</i>?  And if he were to
wear a nice glass helmet and a cape, he would look even more so.  Finally,
his choppy <i>franglais</i> could easily be mistaken for the Martian's
native language.  If Jacques encounters any of these aliens, he will
probably be accepted into their community.  It is then a simple matter to
bring a lifeform back to Earth, or alternatively, blow up the Earth (it
blocks their view of Venus). <p>

No matter how you look at it, Marlin is going to wish he stayed in the
life insurance business. <p>

<B>BRIAN:</B> No zebras on Mars?  Thanks for the newsflash, Steve.  But
I'm afraid you fabricate any possible faunal advantage for Jacques.  You
are wrong in your assertion that large herd animals are all Perkins ever
finds.  He also find birds, rodents, and, yes, even insects.  Not only
that, but many of the animals tracked are nocturnal.  Clearly, Marlin and
Jim will have the skills to find any animal, be it a large beast or a
"featureless blob".  <P>

Cousteau, however, is completely unprepared.  Like I said, there are no
oceans on Mars, and he won't know how to look for anything other than a
fish or squid or unmoving coral formation.  True, if the only life form
does turn out to be a featureless blob, then he may have a shot, given all
the sea cucumbers he has probably tracked down.  Big problem, though: if
he does come across a featureless blob, he'll fry it up in a light
champagne-basil batter and eat it, mistaking it for escargot or one of the
many other featureless blobs that the French consider delicacies.  Marlin,
being American, knows what's food and what isn't, and will present the
find to the NASA cameras. <P>

And I shouldn't need to point this out, but Cousteau will have no supposed
scuba/space suit advantage.  When's the last time Cousteau ever went down
in the water to go after the Bizarre Ocean Freak of the Month (tm)?  He
never does!  He always sends his son down to battle the beast, while he
stays safely in the boat, "making sure the croissants do not get too well
done" (tm, Richard Jeni).  If he ever saw an actual alien, he'd probably
pee in said space suit.  <P>

Finally, it's pretty clear that ol' Marlin will have a few tricks up his
sleeve.  First of all, just look at him.  Try to tell me this guy
<I>won't</I> have a Slim Whitman (tm) album wherever he goes.  Thus, if he
does ever run across those <I>Mars Attacks!</I> martians, he will be
adequately protected.  There's even a good chance that music would explode
Cousteau's head, nevermind the aliens.  Second, Marlin will bring along a
cat and release it near Jacques's stranded boat.  One would suspect that
Jacques would grab the cat, present it to the press, become a laughing
stock and then get kicked off the mission team.  But Marlin would be one
step ahead of you.  For he has brought a black cat and painted a white
stripe down it's back.  Thus, Cousteau reacts as any French person would
upon seeing such a sight ("Zut Alors! Un martienne polecat de skunk pew!")
and cower in the space ship, allowing Perkins to finish the mission at his
leisure.  <P>

<B>STEVE:</B> Brian, those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw
bricks. You accuse Cousteau of never doing his own work? I admit Cousteau
doesn't actually dive as much as he used to. But Jacques exudes pure
experience, and his merely being topside insures a successful dive. 
However, Marlin is far, far worse in this category than Jacques.  An
example: "We watch now as Jim wrestles the crazed cheetah to the ground. 
Those claws are razor sharp!  Oh, it looks as if another cheetah has come
to help it's troubled friend.  It's a good thing Jim is covered by a
<i>Mutual of Omaha</i> life insurance policy." Marlin, of course, won't
lift a finger to help him out.  That is, if he's even on the scene.  He
usually just watches Jim's escapades from the comfort of his elegant
mahogany-paneled office in Nebraska, taking credit for Jim's work.  <p>

And your Slim Whitman remarks show your ignorance of the situation.  Do
you think Slim Whitman is going to bother someone with the musical
heritage of Jacques? It's nothing compared to the music coming from his
native land of France.  Compare it to a stirring rendition of
<i>Alouette</i> played on an accordion.  Or to that Euro-trash music (not
to be confused with Euro-Sealer(tm) or Euro-Can(tm)) that seems to flow
forth from western Europe in neverending quantities. <p>

No, I think you seriously underestimate our friend Jacques -- for he will
have a surprise as well. He will take off his red cap and put on a tall
white chef's hat.  He will then begin to create a fine five course meal in
the tradition of the finest restaurants of France.  The smell of the
cuisine will quickly waft through the thin Martian atmosphere.  Any living
creature within 100 miles will be drawn to the delicious aroma of his
cooking.  Then it's just a matter of the lifeform coming to the food.  As
soon as it eats a piece of that nasty French runny cheese, it will pass
out from the horrible taste, and it will be a simple matter for Jacques to
put it in a net and ship it back to Earth. <p>

<HR>

<B><I>NOTE:  Before anyone mentions it, we know Cousteau is dead.  So is
Perkins.  As we've stressed before, that's not important.  If you mention
it, you will be deleted (unless you get creative, but that's been done
before as well).</B></I>

<h2 align=center>RESPONSE OF THE WEEK (ROTW) (TM)</h2>

I've never even seen Marlin TOUCH an animal.  He just stands and 
narrates, and I don't think he really has much idea what's going 
on. Kind of like Col. Sanders, who would be shot up with a big dose of 
L-dopa every time Kentucky Fried Chicken wanted to film a commercial. 
 He'd become lucid for twenty seconds; once the drool and shit flow 
was temporarily stemmed they'd throw him in that white suit and get 
him to say "finger lickin' good" before he went back into a coma. 
Marlin is a talking prop. <P>

Jacques, though not perfect, was more like Ronald McDonald.  Annoying, 
condescending, arrogant towards his employees, but at least he would 
actually touch the crap he was trying to sell you.  Jacques would 
half-heartedly poke the octopus that young Pierre pulled up on deck 
every episode.  It's not much but it puts him out in front.

It isnt actually Marlin 
or Jacques who does the work, they sit back and provide the narration 
and name for the show. It is the assistant who is always doing the 
work. Here Jim has the clear advantage. He is not merely competent, 
but actually superior to Marlin. Just consider all the times you heard 
Marlin discribe this seen, "Here my friend Jim faces an uncircumcised 
Cape Buffalo with only a piece of sharp onyx to provide assitance in 
bringing me back a foreskin for my collection." 
(Here the ugly truth comes out, Marlin and Jacques were buddies, just 
what do you think that ugly hat is on top of Jacques head, a cotton 
toque? It is a rare gift from his buddy Marlin.)
<P>
This is in comparison to Jacques incompetant son. Jacques has a team 
to prevent Phillipe from ever having to do anything. Recall this 
classic line from the Undersea World, "Here eez my valont team, 
scouring zee bottom of zee cee vit dere bare handz. Back here on zee 
surface in zee boat my son phillipe layz in hiz own vomit after a 
drunken binge brought on by my disgust wit heem." Here on Mars, 
Phillipe is on his own, alone, scared, drunk.
<P>
After he finds life, Jim will have to go find Phillipe. <br>
<P>Victory Jim, and therefore, Marlin.

Hmmmm............ Jacques Cousteau has made a living of 
finding/showing/disturbing/pissing off/catching/probably killing all 
manner of marine life.  Marlin = a really big fish.  Upon arriving on 
the Red Planet (tm), Jacques spots the nametag on Perkins' space suit, 
and proceeds to chase him down, catch him, hang him upside down and 
get some neat snapshots with his "big one".  With no competition, he's 
bound to stumble upon something eventually.  Jacques, in a shade under 
a decade, returns with some odd alien life form and a new trophy for 
the wall.

Cousteau?!?!  Give me a break.  He's French, and while that may be 
great for taunting silly English knights, the French are, in the words 
of another famed WWWF Combatant "cheese-eating surrender monkeys" 
(tm).  At the first sign of alien life on the planet Cousteau will wet 
his pants and offer his ship as the capital of the new regime.  Either 
that, or he will bring the alien life into the ship to study, and in 
the proud tradition of Marie Curie die of exposure to the very thing 
he was studying!  Gotta go with Perkins

<p>
- KSD
<HR>


Well, orignally I thought that Marlin had the advantage here, but as I 
thought through it, I had to give Jacques my vote.  Here's why:
<P>
1.  Nationality:  Jacques is French, but he's an ENVIRONMENTALIST 
Frenchman (tm).  This rules out all French nuclear bomb arguments.  
However, he's probably a bit sneaky and will put sleeping gas in 
Marlin's oxygen container.
Marlin is from the USA(tm).  He'll probably squash any new life forms 
under the wheels of his Range Rover (tm).  Marlin 0 Jacques 1.
<P>
2.  Likely lifeform type:  It is almost certainly small, microscopic. 
Jacques is experienced with plankton.  Marlin is experienced with 
elephants.  Which is smaller?  I forget, so Marlin wins this round.
Jacques 1 Marlin 1.
<P>
3. Terrain:  Marlin knows deserts, Jacques knows oceans.  However, 
Jacques explores oceans in minature space suits, while marlin explores 
deserts in, well, not in a space suit.  Both will be uncomfortable, 
but Mars (tm) is IN space, which is more like an ocean, so I'll give 
this one to Jacques.
<P>
4. Crowd support:  This trip to Mars(tm) will probably be shown live 
on TV.  I live in Australia, and I've never heard of Marlin before 
today.  However, I've known about Jacques for years.  The USA(tm) will 
cheer for Marlin, but the rest of the world will cheer for Jacques 
(particularly the Africans, as a revenge(tm) thing).  Advantage: 
Jacques.
<P>
Jacques 3, Marlin 1.  Not only is this a clear win for Jacques, but 
because of the aformentioned sleeping gas trick that Jacques will 
pull, Marlin will never even have a chance.

<p>
- Zhirrzh
<HR>


While Perkins is out looking for some lifeform to 
exploit (say perhaps by pushing it into a swamp so that he, or rather
Jim, might heroically rescue it), Cousteau will put in the time and do
his homework.  After months of study he will have arrived at a
solution which he then puts into action calmly and professionally.
Jim seeing a real team at work will finally understand that he has 
been carrying Marlin's considerable weight all these years.  He will
defect after giving Marlin a good sound beating.  The Cousteau team
now has all the manpower and the brains and if there is anything there
they will find it. 
<P>
Unfortunately, the now celebrity inhabitants of Mars, will be
assissinated by a multi-corporation hit squad on their return to Earth
after they fail (limited as they are by their minute size) to sign
over the mineral rights to their planet.

Let's face it, if Marlin has Jim, mr. ocean man doesn't stand a 
chance.  Jim will wear out any creature until its out of breath and 
then Marlin will come in, put his foot on the creatures chest, claim 
that Mutual of Omaha gave them the proper protection against the 
beast, and claim victory while Cousteau is talking about the beauty of 
space as being an endless ocean, completely forgetting why he was on 
the mission in the first place.

Jodie Foster would be pissed. A manned mission to contact alien life 
and she's passed up once again. She'd be forced to sit in the 
observation platform while The Chosen continue their preparations. 
<P>
*KABLOOEY*
<P>
Jacques and Marlin both get wasted by the stereotypical religious 
extremists. Either that or they make an ill considered stop for 
supplies on Mir. Regardless, an act of fate leaves both of the 
explorers...dead. Go figure.
<P>
Yes, there was a secret second mission planned. Yes, the Japanese 
probably own it. No, Jodie Foster doesn't get to go. This isn't 
Hollywood, but the nitty gritty world where, despite the propaganda one 
hears on the television, women don't get the opportunities men do. 
Jodie Foster is pissed once again, asking her timeless question, "Who 
gets to go?"
<P>
The Crocodile Hunter. Have you seen this raving lunatic? What man 
eating beasts did Jaques and Marlin take down with their bare hands?? 
If there's life on Mars to be brought back, this boy is stupid enough 
to try it and lucky enough to pull it off.
<P>
Heck, I'd even feel sorry for the aliens.

If it was just Jacques against Marlin, Marlin would lose hands down.  
All I remember Marlin doing is sitting outside the camper in his 
safari outfit.  But Jim Fowler will turn the tide in Marlin's favor.  
Jim is almost Mentos cool.  Jacques on the other hand had a song 
written about him by John Denver.

<p>

<HR>


Oh, come on!  Cousteau has a techno advantage that isn't even funny.  
We're talkin' about the guy who invented the AquaLung!  What did 
Perkins ever invent?  That lasso thingy on the end of a pole?  
<P>
Plus Cousteau has a record of collaborating with some pretty major, 
even legendary, scientists and engineers.  He had his underwater 
strobe lights, his motion-sensitive cameras, his radar before anybody 
else except the Defense Department and the CIA.  Perkins worked for 
an insurance company.  The video cameras were ok, but how much 
technology do you need to find an elephant?  
<P>
And Cousteau really had to worry about the weather on the ocean.  
Now, Mars has those amazing sandstorms that cover a lot of area and 
last a long time.  Cousteau would take 'em seriously and get the hell 
out of Dodge; Marlin and Jim would get caught outside by one and be 
uncovered by an archaeological team 500 years from now under 50 feet 
of sand.

<p>
- kat
<HR>


This match comes down to one simple factor: the ability to 
accessorize.  First of all, Cousteau sports a hat, whereas Perkins 
allows his head to go uncovered.  This makes Cousteau much more prepared 
for the bitterly cold Martian winters.  Let us compare this scenario 
to the history of those in hats vs. their bare-headed peers.  One 
example quickly jumps to mind: Mike Nesmith of the Monkees.  Not only 
was he the unofficial leader of the group, but he also was the only 
one intelligent enough to leave the Monkees in the past when the rest 
of the group started doing reunions.  Thus, it would appear that those 
with covered heads tend to outperform the hat-challenged.
<P>
In addition, Cousteau is accustomed to working in the water.  It 
follows, then, that he would be well-aquainted with towels, using them 
quite frequently.  In fact, he probably carries one with him wherever 
he goes.  As Douglas Adams could tell you, a towel is an invaluable 
tool in space travel; he does not advise beginning such a journey 
without one.  Perkins, however, would leave his towels at home, 
underestimating their importance.
<P>
Let's face it--Cousteau is much better prepared to venture to Mars.  
He wins by virtue of the Boy Scout(tm) factor.

Judging by the radio waves that is being sent in outer space each 
year, by the time the two alien hunters make it to Mars, the Martians 
would have seen both a Jacques Cousteau documentary and the film that 
is about the early years of Marlin Perkins, which is also titled Wild 
America. Upon seeing the latter, the aliens will come to believe that 
either Marlin or one of his brothers is Jonathan Taylor Thomas, and, 
fearing that he will lead performers who are currently having 15 
minutes of fame on Earth to Mars, they will avoid Marlin at all costs. 
Luckily, one of the aliens will meet up with Cousteau and, after 
seeing the documentaries that he made, will go back to Earth with him 
to see what the ocean is really like.

<p>

It all boils down to financial backing.  Marlin Perkins is backed by the Mutual of Omaha Insurance Group, a multi-million dollar corporation with resources to properly equip him for the expedition.  Jacques Cousteau is backed by the Corporation for Public

 Broadcasting, which would still be doing on-air pledge drives while Perkins was half-way to Mars.
<P>
Plus, Jim Fowler would have Phillipe calling him Mama in a New York minute.

<p>
- Richard
<HR>


The object is to "bag" the alien.  This means that Marlin's 
asssisstant Jim is the man for the job.  Sure maybe Marlin isn't 
bagging much more than corn from his office in nebraska but ol' Jimbo 
is out there everytime wrestling everthing from aardvarks to 
zebras (now that doesn't help if they run across some form of zygote, 
but hey most of the dictionary is covered).  And we have even seen 
him put some of the smaller creatures in a bag.  
<P>
Unfortunately things are not so rosy for "le francophone", except for 
the wine perhaps.  Jacque is an intrepid explorer but also an ardent 
conservationist and enviornmentalist, therefore he will adhere to the 
idea that everything is best left in its natural enviornment. ie "no 
bagging and tagging" Even the largest government grant won't persuade 
this man's principles to be swayed.  The publicity of the find won't 
sway him either, he already has the adulation and admiration of 
thousands around the world.
<P>
This is a no-brainer, Marlin through the work of trusty assistant 
Jim.  Poor Jacque is left out in the cold (or hot depending on the 
planet's rotation

Let's think about this, here.  Why would NASA send Marlin Perkins, 
anyway?  Obviously because of his astronomically large <i>LIFE 
INSURANCE POLICY</i> from Mutual of Omaha (tm).  Our Mr. Marlin is 
expendable...even if he does find the first "Martian", Marlin just 
ain't used to dealing with life-forms (just chuckleheading at the 
video of poor, poor Jim).  He'll probably do something stupid and get 
oxidized.  C'est la vie.  Jaques will then step up, charm the lovely 
Martian as only the French can do, and bring the globule home.

The competition really heats up in the pre-mission stages, with both
teams looking to be on top form. Then, just as things are all set to
go, someone at NASA notices the reports that the amino-acids found in
the meteorites were there as a result of sitting under the antarctic
ice for 30,000 years, and the budget-strapped agency, much to
everyone's (especially the bookmakers') chagrin, calls off the
mission. Technically, then, a draw.

Brian and Steve seem caught up in trashing the French . . . I must say that if nationality plays any part in Cousteau's success over Marlin, it will be for simply one reason . . . truffle pigs.  Those pigs can smell a mushroom despite any amount of rot or

 decay that may mask the pleasant mushroom odor from other tracking animals.  I'm sorry, but Marlin just can't compete with a pig.  Go France!

     This reminded me a little of Tarzan vs. Aquaman, because I think it'll depend on whom the *animals* are more likely to come to.  Unless Jacque plans on catching sharks, the animals aren't likely to come to him as quickly.  The animals are more likely

 to come to Marlin, because he looks for ones, like lions and tigers, and zebras, oh my!  (well, hey, they don't have bears in Africa, all right?!) They are less afraid of him because they consider him to be possible food. (Or his assistant to be possible

 food.) <P>
     So, the question remains, which kind are on Mars?  It won't matter.  A fellow named Dr. Smith will stow away, wanting to go along, and accidentally send the spaceship way off course, until it lands on some unchartered planet.  Strange aliens who thin

k both would be good food (well, think all 3 would be) come along and chase them all around.  However, Jacques, without the experience of having animals try to turn him into their dinner, will perish, while Marlin, who has evaded those huge lions, etc. wi

th the ferocious appetites, eludes them.  Of course, as long as Dr. Smith is around, he'll never made it back home, but he will win by default.

The Mars Rover aside, interplanetary travel isn't cheap. You've got to 
look at the backing here. Perkins has Mutual of Omaha, a two-bit 
insurance scam from a one-horse town. They didn't even have the money 
to send Perkins out of the office most of the time. Instead, Jim had 
to fly to Kenya on stand-by tickets or work his way to Australia on a 
cargo ship.
<P>
Jacques, on the other hand, has both PBS and the National Geographic 
Society behind him. If PBS can blow more than $10 mil on an 18-hour 
history of baseball, Prekins is already outclassed by a factor of ten. 
Let's not forget corporate sponsorships. Through PBS, Jacques will 
have ADM (Supermarket to the World), Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell 
International, the Pew Charitable Trusts and viewers like you behind 
him. As for National Geographic, they're one of the largest membership 
organizations in America. Sure, Jacques is French. But with National 
Geographic, he'll have the American people behind him. And when was 
the last time America backed a loser? What's Perkins got? Nebraska? 
<P>
Like Chuck Yeager never figured out in The Right Stuff, whoever has 
the bucks gets the toys. It takes them toys to get to Mars. Jacques 
will ride in style, with Bill Moyers along for conversation and Ken 
Burns filming every moment. Perkins, I'm sad to say, will be lucky if 
he can hitch a ride to Mir.

We've all seen Mars Attacks, 
and at least one of a number of War Of The Worlds remakes, and we've 
even seen Bugs Bunny in action, so we know that Martians are 
universally nasty bastards who want to conquer Earth and eat everyone. 
Fortunately for both contenders, they've had past experience with 
nasty fauna. Jaqcue-Cousteou will have an industrial strength shark 
cage with Heat Ray deflectors so that he won't be at risk, and Marlin 
will pack an industrial grade elephant gun. Initially, this will mean 
that both have fair chances of survival, but then the movie cliches 
come in. We all know that the impenetrable fortress is the first place 
to go. Look at Independance Day when they took out the Vice President. 
That goddamn mountain can withstand nuclear blasts, yet they still 
wiped it off the map. So Jacque's gone. And we also know that 
conventional Earth weaponry can't deal with extra-terrestrial armies 
of doom, so after a few potshots, the aliens will close in and eat Marlin 
alive. So that's both of them down in the event of a hostile first 
contact.
<P>
So let's look at things. Neither of them can deal with it alone, but 
they might manage by pooling their resources. Alas, they are both from 
countries full of arrogant dipsticks, and will be too stubborn to do 
so. Therefore, the answer is to wipe out the competition and use his 
resources to deal with the aliens. Unfortunately for Jacques, he 
forgot to bring a gun, whereas our intrepid explorer of the African 
unknown is generally pretty well armed. A quick "accidental discharge" 
later, and Marlin Perkins now has access to everything he needs to bag 
a pesky alien. And of course, he will actually survive his run in 
with the little green men, as the third law of sci-fi states that 
there must always be at least one survivor no matter how lethal the 
aliens are.

Well, I feel that the outcome is obvious. Mr. Perkins as we can all 
see resembles Walt Disney to a remarkable degree which is probably 
what most little kids would have thought themselves. Now imagine being 
in Marlin's shoes, having to disappoint thousands of hopeful eyed 
chldren in his years by telling them 'No, I'm not Walt.' Can you feel 
the pain he must have felt every time as those innocent eyes turned to 
deep wells of cynicism as the realities of life are piled upon such 
young shoulders? Well? Of course not. It's not as if everybody goes 
through his or her life stripping away all childhood optimism. So, 
obviously, all this pent up pain will manifest itself when Marlin 
hears Jacques kiddie voice and Marlin will snap.

I voted for Jacques Cousteau because of a True Event (tm) from a few 
years ago while he was still alive...
<BR>
Yes it's true Jacques didn't do any of his own work for many years 
aboard the Calypso (tm), relying on his progeny to dive for his dinner 
oysters and the odd bizzare ocean freak (tm).  In this case, Marlin 
Perkins never had a chance because Jacques brought the ultimate force 
at his disposal to Mars.  
<BR>
LAWYERS!
<BR>
  A few years ago, the lawyers of the Cousteau Society were going to 
sue the shit out of the internationally known icon of Sonoma County, 
California; Clo the Cow (tm) for making an appearence on a billboard 
for Marine World disguised as "Jacques Cowsteau." Someone driving by 
who couldn't see the pun for the ocean told the Cousteau Society about 
it, and they scrambled their legal team to combat this highly 
subversive affront to their employer, citing something about "not 
lending the good strong French name of 'Jacques Cousteau' to 
commercial ventures."
<BR>
As we all know, lawyers are the scum of the earth next to Republicans, 
but when a highly paid (or at least a well-fed) legal squad threatens 
a lawsuit against A COW...
<BR>
Needless to say, Cousteau brought along his lawyers from the Calypso 
Society who then proceeded to shut poor Marlin down for letting his 
<I>Mutual of Omaha</I> insurance policy lapse, thereby sealing the fate 
of Marlin's dear friend Jim, who was fatally injured by the razor-
sharp claws of a crazed Martian cheetah.

Marlin Perkins was dead long before he ever "died". Why do you think he never left the studio? Because he didn't want to go too far after coming out of cryo-sleep for that week. He'd pop out of his cold-chamber, blather on for a bit while Jim was getting 

lacerated by some strange breed of falcon, plug Mutual of Omaha a few dozen times, and slide back into his icy paradise for another week.
On the other hand, Cousteau walks the walk and talks the talk. He was diving when he was, like, three or something. He invented dozens of diving gadgets and gizmoes. (When did Marlin Perkins ever invent anything? Even his cryochamber was invented by Walt 

Disney.) Jacques singlehandedly *invented* the idea of undersea exploration. <P>
So it's easy to see who wins. Traveling along the surface of Mars, Jacques will discover life after a couple of months--and convince it to go scuba-diving, no less--while poor Marlin Perkins will shatter in a rain of icy shards when he trips over a rock w

ith a cutesy name like "Brainy Smurf".

Marlin Perkins will win. He always got Jim Fowler to do the real dirty 
work. While Jim, nattily attired in a bush jacket and a pith helmet, 
is kicking Jacques' sorry French ass, ol' Marlin will be back on Earth 
watching the whole thing through a telescope from the balcony of the 
Nairobi Hilton, and drinking tequila shooters. Naturally, before the 
expedition, Marlin will have taken out a hefty Mutual of Omaha life 
insurance policy on Jim, just in case Cousteau should manage to get 
the upper hand. . . .

You know, most of the different types of life on the earth arose from 
the oceans, and a majority still reside there.  As such, Jacques 
probably has a strong advantage in the variety of life department.  
But that really doesn't matter nearly as much as the simple Cunning 
Factor (TM).  Quite simply, Marlin is a chump.  Heck, his name is a 
fish, and I'm sure Jacques has fried a few, if ya know what I mean.  
As you mentioned, Marlin is having a bit of trouble from all those 
years spent smoking cigarettes, and needs his depleted, tar-filled 
lungs to suck in as much oxygen as possible.  Jacques is used to 
rebreathing equipment, and will adjust the oxygen levels on Marlin's 
suit to a dangerously high level.  Then, like the true predator, he'll 
sit back and wait for the nicotine to do its job.  Sooner or later, 
Perkins is gonna go for the cancer stick, he can't help it!  Everyone 
can imagine the true delight on Jacques face, as he calmly watches 
Marlin prepare to light up the sky.  Quietly, as Marlin strikes his 
match, Jacques can be heard to whisper "Zee hapless Marlin-fish iz 
zweeming clo-sair and clo-sair to destruction."  Since Marlin was the 
brains of the duo and Jim was the brawn, it shouldn't take much work 
for Jacques to enlist Jim as their "guide."  Then he just kicks back 
with Philippe and waits for Jim to be killed by one of the native 
species and "Blammo!" we have life on Mars.

   Gotta go with the French Dude(tm).  First off, the French NEED this 
win.  As mentioned before, the French haven't done anything since 
Nepolean so they will have the Rage(tm) factor, in a similar fashion 
to the Broncos of SuperBowl XXXII.  (i.e. they know they sucked before 
and they need a big win to show that they don't.)  The Americans on 
the other hand don't really care.  As far as they're concerned, 
Mars is old news.  They got the Mars Probe there, checked it out, made 
the headlines already, and so they just arn't into this competition. <P>
   The second reason is a little more technical.  Mars at one time 
many millions of years ago actually did have oceans.  There is tons of 
evidence of huge planet wide floods.  What this means is that Jack 
will definately be closer to his element.  Although he's a few 
millions years late he will know what he's lookin' at. . .ocean floor.

As a long time watcher of both PBS and the Discovery Channel (I'm not 
using my real name, I'd hate it if my friends found out!) I have 
experience with the styles of both of these reputed animal life 
hunters.  The edge obviously goes to Cousteau with his undersea 
experience.  NASA even uses underwater training for astronauts.  The 
low G, low oxygen environment of Mars is much closer to the deep sea 
environment Cousteau and his team is accustomed to.  Now to the real 
point of the argument, the key to the contest is the team.  Both 
commentators mentioned that neither Cousteau nor Perkins has done any 
actual field work in some time.  They'll both stay on the mothership 
while their kroneys do the actual work, while they monitor things from 
above.  Both Perkins and Cousteau have ample experience in this area, 
be it from a boat or a comfortable office.  What it comes down to is 
that Phillip, with his underwater experience and scientific background 
has all the advantages.  He'd never end up in a fight with a shark or 
something, much less a Martian amoeba.  The commentary about Jim 
fighting cheetahs shows his true colors.  He is a hunter not a 
scientist.  As a result, Phillip may not find the aliens first, but 
his scientific inclination will insure that he saves the aliens for 
research, while Jim's hunter instincts may enable him to find the 
aliens, he will have little regard for the purpose of the mission, and 
this will be his undoing.

The key factor in this match is hygiene.  The French are worse in this 
category than any nation that doesn't have to import all its water. 
(French water is another sordid topic entirely.)  Remember, these are 
the people who invented the bidet so they could get away with washing 
half their bodies.  In the cramped confines of an interplanetary 
expedition, bad will get worse. <P>

No, Jacques won't win by asphyxiating Marlin with his stench.  He'll 
win by mutation. <P>

There won't be any life on Mars when they arrive -- that meteorite was 
over three *billion* years old -- but that will change.  Mars' 
atmosphere filters virtually no solar radiation.  One little microbe 
carried on Jacques' crusty hide will get hit by a gamma ray, and begin 
changing ... <P>

Nobody will know this as the explorers dejectedly return to Earth with 
empty nets.  The only warning sign will come during reentry, as 
Jacques clutches his stomach.  He and Marlin assume it's the last of 
the tinned escargot, until something bursts through his abdomen and -- 
well, you've seen the movie. <P>

The creature is technically native to Mars, and Jacques does bring it 
back, so victory goes to Cousteau.  Granted, most of Earth's 
population is eviscerated by the beast and its progeny,  but you 
weren't really concerned about them, now were you?

While cousteuo was born in france, he is a resident of monaco.  The calypso II is the only science research vessel equipped with a casino.  Clousteuo sank the calypso I when he parked it over a pile in singapore at high tide.  Tide goes out, ship turns tu

rtle.  Not very inspiring.  I think he and his son got into scuba just to impress chicks.  I seem to recall perkins did go on safari once.  He was wrestling a giant snake at the water hole.  perkins almost became a meal.  Jim had to go save his sorry wrin

kled ass.  Perkins was looking a lot like a drowned rat, and never went on safari again.  Now jim is a real dynamo.  He saves condors, he tags cheetahs, he even films sharks underwater. Land, sea, or air, jim is the man.  While jackque and Phileepaye are 

playing blackjack with the rest of the crew, and perkins is at the comms console keeping houston apprised of the safari and the latest insurance options, jim will be exploring the great canal or spelunking the polar ice caves.  Ultimately he will wrestle 

the giant martian snow yeti back to the landing craft. Unfortunately, clousteuo parked the orbiter in the path of Phobos, and all is lost.  (just as an aside at the risk of being deleted, while perkins may be dead, he was dead during the entire wild kingd

om show, and this did not seem to hamper him a bit.  Cousteuo probably faked his death to collect enough life insurance to finance the calypso II.)  Anyway, victory for the perkins-fowler team.

I have to side with the pro-Marlin contingent on this one. Sure, he always sends Jim out to subdue the blood-crazed, 1,000-pound junglecat while relaxing in the comfort of a hut somewhere with a nubile young maiden and a margarita. Which only emphasizes t

he Marlster's skills as a master strategist. By the time this eight-limbed Martian beastie is through devouring Jim, it will be too exhausted and lethargic to put up much of a fight. From there, it's a simple task for Marlin to swoop in on his NASA-custom

ized Landrover and drop a net on it. Jaques, like all true Frenchman, will be cowering under a table somewhere waiting for the Americans' to save his wrinkled pelegiac ass. There's no doubt -- this one goes to Monsieur (sic?) Perkins.

Much as I hate to admit it Marlin is going to clean up on this one.
When was the last time you saw Monsieur Cousteau remove any creature
from its native habitat?  I tell you when, NEVER!  Marlin on the other 
hand would shoot his own mother with a tranquilizer dart just to see
how long it takes Jim to hogtie and stuff her in a cage! I can't 
remember one single episode of Wild Kingdom where some poor animal 
wasn't drugged and tied up so they could get a better look at it.
Oh sure Jacques would return with hundreds of hours of narrated film 
footage but that's not what NASA wants.  They want a specimen.  So for 
the first one to bring home a woozie trussed up alien it's got to be 
Marlin.

        The Martian Lander(tm) touches down on the red planet 
and, being the zoological Thomas Edisons that they are, Marlin 
and Jacques send their lieutenants out onto the Martian terrain 
equipped with complete communications gear the better to 
narrate from the comfort of the Lander(tm).  Phillipe points 
his Martian Gyro-Copter(MGC) for the polar ice cap on the 
theory that water, liquid or otherwise, has the best chance of 
yielding lifeforms for study, while "Jungle" Jim Fowler drives 
his rover to the nearest "canal." <P>
        Things look bad for the Cousteau team when Philippe, in 
an unintentional and tragic replay of history, smashes his MGC 
into Olympus Mons. <P>
        When Fowler, Cousteau and a truly reluctant Perkins 
arrive at the scene, Jacques dutifully mourns the loss of his 
son but sees an opportunity and takes Fowler aside and tempts 
him away from Marlin with the prize of a full hour in prime 
time and full National Geographic funding.  The two convince 
Perkins that the polar cap is the place to go and, using 
Cousteau's expertise in developing exploration gear, the three 
devise an ultra-heated environment suit for Jim to use while 
exploring the crevasses of the polar ice. <P>
        Sensing Perkins' sulking discontent, the cagey 
Frenchman exhibits some of the talent that won him his Legion 
D'Honour and orders NASA to send a lab animal to their 
location.  Warner Brothers Studios (you opened the door Brian) 
is consulted for rapid delivery purposes. <P>
        Soon after sending the request, an animated shuttle 
arrives with none other than Bugs Bunny aboard.  Not hindered 
by the laws of physics (he never studied law) Bugs proceeds to 
mistake the name Marlin for Marvin and wreaks Bunny Fu upon the 
hapless Perkins as Fowler and Cousteau retreive the first 
delicate sample of extra-terrestrial life;  a Martian
Ice Snail. <P>
        Back at the Lander(tm), Cousteau and Fowler enjoy the 
Kudos from the scientific community via satellite as they dine 
on Escargot Polaris Martianus (hey, so they harvested more than 
one sample!) <P>
        Marlin Perkins OTOH returns to the Lander somewhat the

At the risk of being deleted and thus losing out on thousands of

of these men are dead.  The reason this is pertinent is that anyone
who has seen the two programs knows that Marlin Perkins has had a 
lifetime of experience being dead.  This first became obvious in the
Wild Kingdom(tm) episode in which Marlin helped the locals wrestle a
90 foot anaconda out of the river.  "You take the tail, Marlin.

The small lander from the Mars Conestoga touchs the ruddy ground, and 
four spacesuited figures emerge from it.
<P>
"My!  Wasn't the ride down exciting!" Marlin explains.
<P>
"Oui, oui," Jacques agrees.  "Eet was most ex-hil-air-ate-eeng.  Ooh, 
now, see the byooteful landscape, the magneefeecent desolation.  Thees 
ees ze land of Mars, Greek God of War, yet mankind have come heere een 
peace...."
<P>
[Round one: Cousteau 1, Perkins 0.  Nobody can give a soliliquy like 
Jacques.]
<P>
They go their separate ways, Marlin and Jim taking a rover north while 
Jacques and Phillippe travel around Candor Chasma.  Let's go take a 
look at their first encounter with the vicious Martian alligator wolf, 
already in progress....
<P>
Marlin and Jim ride in the rover, looking out accross the landscape.  
They stop and go over to examine some tracks.  Let's listen to 
Marlin's commentary:
<P>
"We're going accross the plains now!  It's quite a sight, but it looks 
dead!  But all is not as it looks on the Martian landscape!"
<P>
Jim: "Uh, Marlin, don't say things like that, you're scaring me."
<P>
"Why, look what our expedition has found!"  He stops the rover, and 
both of them step out and walk over to the tracks.  "We've found 
tracks!  Large ones, as well!  Jim is measuring the tracks, and with 
the expedition's computer we will try to determine just how big this 
animal is!"
<P>
Jim looks at the computer's result, and clicks the safety off his 
rifle, looking around warilly and wishing he'd brought a LAW.
<P>
"So, Jim, how big is it?" <br>
"It's big, Marlin."
<P>
With a shriek and a howl (and some sounds that maybe it's best not to 
explain) the Martian alligator wolf bounds over some rocks and tries 
pouncing Jim!
<P>
"We've found life on Mars!  Jim is now trying to defend himself from 
the creature's vicious attacks!  We seem to have been travelling in 
it's hunting ground!  Jim attempts to wrestle a radio tag onto it -- 
don't worry, Jim, we've got Mutual of Omaha(tm) on our side!  They'll 
cover the cost of a new leg!  Jim looks like he's got his second wind, 
and now the animal and he are starin each other down... suddenly it 
poces again, but Jim's ready for it--!
<P>
Meanwhile, in Candor Chasma:
<P>
"See de byooteeful walls, etched ere untld millenia agoo... Phillippe, 
I thirst." <br>
"Oui, oui!  Sacre bleu, est there no -water- ere!" <br>
"I shall get ze wine from ze pack... Oh, stop ze carre!" <br>
The rover stops, and the two oceanographers step out and look down at 
the alligator wolf's prints.
<P>
"Here ve have evidence' of life on Mars, ze first tracks zeen by Man. 
 Here on ze ancient surface of ze planet."
<P>
The alligator wolf jumps out from behind a rock with a woof and a yowl 
(and still more noises that it's best you don't try to repeat for your 
 eighty-year-old grandmother.)
<P>
Phillippe gasps, "Father!  Est ze creature oo made zee tracks!  I 
shall get ze gun--!"
<P>
"Non, Phillippe.  Man shall come to zis planet vith rezpect for ze 
native life... Ve vill not come to rape an pillage zis wolrd as ve did 
ze Moth-air Earth.  Ere we see before us... a creature of zee Martian 
land, living until now vith no fear of hu-man-et-ie...."
<P>
[Round Two: Cousteau 1, Perkins 1.  Marlin perkins could give an 
exciting play-by-play recount of anything.  He might even be good 
enough for WWWF, but that's for when -- and if -- he returns to 
Earth.]
<P>
IN all, the alligator wolf is lulled to sleep by Cousteaus' talking, 
and the French put it ito a special cage 'based on ze world-famouse 
aqualung' which, of course, Cousteau invented, and bring their prize 
back to Earth.  Marlin and Jim have to settle for radiotagging their 
alligator wolf.
<P>
In all, Cousteau 2 Perkins 1.  Cousteau wins by a hair and goes on to 
make another full season of National Geographic specials, while 
Perkins and Jim continue to try to capture a live animal from Mars.

I'm sorry but Marlin Perkins has no shot.  Every time I hear that name 
I think of Opus the Penguin of the Bloom County comic strip. 
Investigative reporter Milo Bloom and Opus went in search of the 
elusive Basselope, a beast half Basset Hound, half Antelope and as 
dangerous as a warm bath.  Opus couldn't handle the 
stress and thought he was Marlin Perkins.<p>

Now for those who don't know, Opus is the ultimate wimp.  He wanted 
the United States to surrender to the Communists.  He's so naive that 
he thought Greenpeace was a cruise line service.  He played a 
<i>tuba</i> in heavy metal group for goodness sake.  The bird is not 
only a wimp, he is the ARCHWIMP(tm). And for him to think of Marlin 
Perkins as a hero makes Mr. Perkins a wimp by association.  A Wimp 
Hero(tm) perhaps, but still a wimp.<p>

Boys, boys, you've missed it completely.  The press, sent along to 
record the findings of this momentous mission, are the clear winners 
-- pictures will stream back to Earth of Cousteau in a compromising 
position with the cabin-boy, while hidden live-cams will catch Marlin 
crouching behind a hill, throwing live Martian Lemmings over the 
clifftop while Jim records their 'unusual migration patterns' below.
Both men will be particle-beamed back to America and forced to 
double-date with Monica Lewinski and Linda Tripp.

Marlin Perkins floors his Mars Rover towards the shuttle.  He's got a 
Mac (from Mac and Me) under his antiquated arm, and is hoping to beat 
the unwashed Frenchman to the camera to report his findings.  As he 
beats the Mac thing into submission to stop its squirming, he sees the 
other Rover already parked by the ship.  He rushes inside, muppet in 
hand, to see, to his horror, Cousteau showing the camera the pulsating 
pod from the 1996 straight-to-video waste of film Lifeform (which no 
one ever watches unless they mistake it for Lifeforce at the video 
store.)  </p>
Horrified at coming up second, Perkins takes the helmet off his suit 
and prepares for a Ronny Cox.  But as his spindly hand tries its best 
to grip the door outside, he remembers a crucial bit of information: 
Jacques Cousteau is dead.</p>
"Imposter!" he yells as he rips the fleshy mask off the Cousteau- 
looking thing.  A strange face looks back at Perkins: Carl Sagan.</p>
"Hey, you're dead, too!" Perkins yells, ripping off the second mask, 
and finding Gene Roddenberry underneath.  He continues to take the 
masks off, throwing away L. Ron Hubbarb, Werner Von Braun, Randy 
Meeks, Woodrow Wilson and the dead Bee-Gee before finding the true 
face of his companion.</p>
Joe Piscopo.</p>
"Who the hell are you?" Perkins asked.  "What are you doing here?"</p>
"I was bored.  I've been eating Chevy Chases at the Five Timer's Club 
and collecting my $35 royalty checks from GNC the past 11 years..  I 
figured I could go in space."</p>
At this point Perkins launches the shuttle, reenters space, makes a 
small hole in the window, and sucks Piscopo out chunk by bloody chunk. 
He takes the remaining face chunk and feeds it to Mac.

"Kneel before our King, slimy airbreathers!" barked one of the Martian guards as they neared the empty, ornate, zebra-skin-upholstered throne. "Slimy airbreathers?" muttered another guard. "Sorry, I've always wanted to say that" replied his comrade. The C

aptain didn't have time to shush them, however, for it was then that footsteps were heard coming down a side corridor to the right, and the guards knelt quickly in humble respect for their King. As he entered regally, strategically placed speakers pumped 

out the royal fanfare, the opening horn riffs from "That's Alright, Mama". The feeling that they had been transported to Las Vegas in the early 70's was reinforced by the white sequined jumpsuit, which enclosed a form returned to slenderness. His voice dr

ipped with Southern drawl and curiosity just as readily as the butter dripped from his left hand, which held a grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich. <P>
"Who have y'all brought before me today, Captain Zleeg?" <P>
"Those who you knew were coming, O Swivel-hipped One. They landed at the monument we carved to you, just as you predicted they would. The capture was child's play; the Frenchmen surrendered on sight, and the American's tranquilizer rifles were no defense 

against the karate moves you taught us. Private Zerhj is still a little groggy from that one dart, but he should be just fine." <P>
"Very Good Captain. Thanka, thanka veramuch. Ah don't know why NASA thought they could violate our deal", Elvis drawled, turning his gaze to the imprisoned explorers. "And worst of all, they send some gutless frogs up here, like you American boys needed t

he help! But I'll tell you what, I'm willing to be nice about this, since I liked y'all's TV shows. Here's the deal Ahm willin' to give y'all" <P>
So here are the resultsIn a few months you will see a new chain of "Jungle Room" fast food restaurants spring up all over the U.S. and France, featuring a menu of the King's favorite delicacies (such as beer-marinated hog jowls dipped in white chocolate)

, rendered fat and cholesterol free by advanced Martian technology. Conspiracy theorists will point out the fact that the upper management of the company is secret, and believe it to be a UN plot to soften us up for world domination, but the undiscovered 

reality (that two supposedly dead celebrity explorers are running it from a secret command center in Jackson Hole) is even more shocking. NASA sends no more secret collection missions to Mars, since Elvis told them that it's not his fault that they let Ro

seanne Barr escape, and they can't have any more specimens. Also, If you analyze any radio or TV transmission involving the Spice Girls, you'll find that it contains a strange piggyback signal. This signal prevents Martian electronic devices from processi

ng the information; thereby stopping the epidemic of Spice Girl induced psychosis among Martians who accidentally tuned in at the wrong time, which is why Elvis deported them to Earth in the first place. Elvis ain't taking them back, but if NASA wants to 

send Dennis Rodman back, that's OK, he makes great pork rind and chicken fried steak casserole.
