The following Physics Challenges are for Duke
undergraduates and others to enjoy. The motivation for
these problems comes from Mark Twain's famous quip that
"I have never let my schooling interfere with my
education." and similarly I think physics is too much
fun to restrict just to classrooms, labs, and homework
assignments.
<p>
If you would like to propose a solution to a Challenge, talk
about one of the Challenges, or get a hint, please send me
e-mail at <A
HREF="mailto:hsg@phy.duke.edu">hsg@phy.duke.edu</A> or drop
by my office in the Physics building, Room&nbsp;097. Please
also forward to me any neat problems that you find or invent
that would be fun to present as a challenge.

You are given two identical steel balls of radius
5&nbsp;cm. One ball is resting on a table, the other ball is
hanging from a string. Both balls are heated (e.g.,
with a blow torch) until their radii have increased to the
same value of 5.01&nbsp;cm. Which ball absorbed more heat

<p>
While walking through an open field on a windy day, you
accidentally step on a nest of killer bees. In which
direction should you run to save your life? Will you be able
to run fast enough to escape?  
<p>
For this Challenge, assume that the wind is blowing from the

fact that bees have an experimentally measured maximum speed
of about 8&nbsp;meters/sec (18&nbsp;miles/hour). The fastest
runners can attain 10&nbsp;meters/sec (23&nbsp;miles/hour),
most people much less than that.

As someone living near the beginning of the
21st&nbsp;century, can you explain a problem that badly
perplexed the ancient Greeks and Romans (and also
people throughout the medieval ages): how come clouds
don't come crashing down to the ground? After all,
clouds are made of water droplets and ice crystals
which are about 800&nbsp;times more dense than air,
comparable in density to rocks. So why don't clouds
fall like a rock to the ground?  To give this problem
focus, propose some specific experiments that you could
carry out that would help you to discover the answer.

Two trains each traveling at 30&nbsp;km/hour are

<p>
When you write your name on paper using a pencil, you create
a thin layer of graphite.  Invent and carry out an
elementary experiment to estimate how many atoms thick is
your signature.
<p>
Note: The graphite in a pencil is a pure form of carbon
consisting of many planar sheets of carbon atoms
stacked one above the other. The carbon atoms have
strong bonds within a planar sheet and much weaker
bonds between the sheets and so one sheet can slide
rather easily with respect to an adjacent sheet, which
explains why graphite is so useful as pencil lead. The
spacing between sheets has been measured by X-ray
crystallography to be 0.34&nbsp;nanometers from which
you can then determine from your experiment how many
atomic sheets thick is your signature.

In watching a cowboy movie, you may have noticed that the
wagon wheels of a stagecoach sometimes rotate the wrong way:
the stagecoach may be moving left to right across the movie
screen while the spokes of the wheel rotate backwards
(counterclockwise). If a movie displays 24&nbsp;frames per
second, if the wagon wheels are 5&nbsp;feet tall and have
eight spokes each, and if the horses pull the stagecoach
left to right at 20&nbsp;miles/hour (32&nbsp;km/hour), will
the wagon spokes be rotating forward or backwards compared
to the direction of the stagecoach?  What will the movie
audience perceive as the angular velocity of the wheels?

<p>
Consider three identical square planar mirrors that are
glued together to form three adjacent sides of a cube
meeting at a corner, with the mirrored sides all facing
towards each other. Show that these mirrors act as a
universal reflector that sends light back to its source: any
light beam entering this arrangement of mirrors will leave
parallel and opposite to its original direction.
<p>
If you look into such a corner reflector, what kind of image
will you see of your face?
<p>
Note: Such corner reflectors were left on the surface
of the moon by Apollo astronauts and were used in
ranging experiments, in which laser beams from an
observatory on Earth were bounced off the surface of
the Moon and returned to the observatory, with the time
of transit being measured.  This enabled the distance
from the Earth to the Moon to be measured with high
accuracy which has been useful in testing the theory of
general relativity and also for investigating the
geology and origin of the Moon.

Challenge&nbsp;17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Candy-Bar Powered
Marathon Runner
</B>
</FONT>&nbsp;
<p>
A candy bar provides about 300&nbsp;calories of energy. By
thinking about the physics of running, estimate how many
candy bars a person would have to eat to obtain enough
energy to run a Boston Marathon of 26&nbsp;miles and
385&nbsp;yards (42.2&nbsp;kilometers), if that person weighs
65&nbsp;kg (143&nbsp;lb) and is 1.7&nbsp meters tall (5 feet
7 inches).
<p>
Note 1: A food calorie is a so-called "large calorie", the
amount of energy needed to raise one kilogram of water one
degree Celsius at atmospheric pressure, and is equal to
about 4.2 kilojoules.
<p>
Note 2: Estimating orders of magnitudes of phenomena is a
fun and important skill and often provides surprisingly
useful insights into some problems. A famous historical
example was the order-of-magnitude estimate by Lord Rayleigh
(1842-1919) of the lifetime of the sun if it obtained its
heat from chemical means (e.g., burning coal). His estimated
lifetime was orders of magnitude shorter than known
geological and evolutionary times and so strongly suggested
that the sun obtained its energy by some unknown
non-chemical mechanism, which we now know to be nuclear
fusion.
<p>
Note 3: <a href="http://hope.caltech.edu/oom"> Physics 103b

of magnitude. Its web page has problems with solutions that

You are enjoying a Caribbean vacation and happen to
have a stopwatch with you at the beach. As you watch
the sun set over the ocean, you carry out the following
eccentric sequence of events: (1), you lie down on your
stomach in the sand and wait until the top of the sun
just disappears below the horizon; (2), you then
quickly stand up and simultaneously start your
stopwatch. By standing up, a bit of the sun is now
visible again and (3), you wait until the top of the
sun again dips below the horizon, at which point you
stop the stopwatch. Knowing this elapsed time, your
height, and that a day lasts 24&nbsp;hours, explain how
you can deduce the radius of the Earth. (And next time
you find yourself watching a sunset at the beach, give
this a try and compare your answer with the known value
of 6400&nbsp;km.)

Challenge 22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you trust your heart?
</B>
</FONT>
<br><br>

According to Daniel Boorstein in his interesting book
"The Discoverers" (Random House, 1983), Galileo was
nineteen years old in&nbsp;1583 when he made the
apparent discovery that the period&nbsp;T of a pendulum
seemed to be independent of the amplitude&nbsp;A of its
swing (measured in radians, with zero radians
corresponding to the pendulum being directly underneath
its support). He was supposedly attending prayers in
the baptistery of the Cathedral of Pisa and was
distracted by the swinging of an altar lamp, whose
period did not seem to change as its amplitude slowly
diminished.
<p>
In fact, as you hopefully know, the period of a pendulum
<strong> does </strong> depend on the amplitude of the
swing, becoming longer as the amplitude becomes larger.  So
here is an interesting historical question: could Galileo
have discovered this while in the baptistery? (He did
discover this later on in his life.) The only clock he would
have had available in the baptistery would have been his
heartbeat. Since this is an unreliable clock (one's
heartbeat can speed up or slow down), this raises an
interesting physics question: given an unreliable clock and
some knowledge of what makes it unreliable, how accurately
can one measure a time interval or difference in time
intervals?
<p>
Try to do some history of science and determine whether
Galileo could have detected the nonlinear dependence of
period on amplitude by just using his heartbeat as a
clock. Let's guess that the length&nbsp;L of the lamp's
support was L=10&nbsp;meters and that the amplitude of
motion was moderate, say A=20&nbsp;degrees from the
vertical.
<ol>
<li>
Using the approximate formula "T = 2 Pi Sqrt[L/g] ( 1 +
(1/16) A<sup>2</sup> + ...&nbsp;)" for the period T of a
pendulum of amplitude A measured in radians (with L its
length and g=10 meter<sup>2</sup>/sec the acceleration of
gravity), estimate in seconds the difference in period
between an amplitude of 20 degrees and zero degrees.
Galileo would have had to detect this small difference in
time to realize that the period depended on amplitude.
<p>
Note: This formula is derived in many textbooks and is
surprisingly accurate, even for amplitudes as large as 45
degrees (see "Mechanics, 3rd Ed." by L. D. Landau and
E. M. Lifshitz (Pergamon Press,1976), Section&nbsp;11.)
<p>
</li>
<li>
Assume that Galileo's heart beat on average 60&nbsp;beats
per minute but could beat as fast as 70&nbsp;beats per
minute or as slow as 50 beats a minute at any given time. By
counting heart beats, could Galileo have detected the small
difference in period between a nearly vertical lamp (A=0)
and a swinging lamp with A=20&nbsp;degrees?

Challenge&nbsp;25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Law of
reflection for a moving mirror.
</B>
</FONT>
<br><br>

An elementary fact that people learn about mirrors is the
law of reflection, that the angle of incidence of a light
beam striking the mirror (as measured with respect to a
normal) equals the angle of reflection.
<p>
Does this law also hold for a mirror that is moving?
Consider a square mirror that is moving at speed&nbsp;v in a
direction perpendicular to the mirror. (You can think of the
mirror as starting in the xy-plane and moving in the
positive z&nbsp;direction of a Cartesian coordinate system.)
As the mirror approaches a certain observation point, a
friend shines a laser beam of frequency w at the mirror so
that the beam makes an angle A with the normal to the
mirror. (You can think of the beam as lying in the
yz-plane.)
<p>
What angle and frequency will you measure for the reflected
light beam? Does the law of reflection still hold?
<p>
Do your conclusions change if the mirror moves parallel,
rather than perpendicular, to its plane (say in the
y&nbsp;direction if it starts in the xy-plane)?
<p>
Note: The large mirror of the Hubble space telescope is an
example of a mirror in motion as it orbits the earth. From
your analysis, do you think the users of the Hubble have to
take into account the motion of the mirror when measuring
properties of its images?

Challenge&nbsp;26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First-order
single-variable dynamics are asymptotically boring
</B>
</FONT>
<br><br>

Consider some quantity y(t) that varies with time&nbsp;t,
e.g., the pressure, temperature, mass, voltage, or chemical
concentration of some system. Show that if this quantity
evolves according to a first-order ordinary differential
equation of the form dy/dt=f(y) with f(y) some
differentiable function, then the asymptotic (nontransient)
dynamics of y(t) are boring: y(t) either diverges to
infinity (which is unphysical) or y(t) approaches a constant
time-independent behavior. In particular, no matter how
complicated the function f(y), the asymptotic behavior can
never be oscillatory.
<p>
Note&nbsp;1: In thinking about this problem, try to use a
qualitative approach based on the possible signs (negative,
zero, or positive) of the function f(y) rather than on any
detailed properties of this function.
<p>
Note&nbsp;2: This elementary and neat result suggests that
one needs at least <em> two </em> coupled variables or a
higher-order time derivative to get nontransient
non-constant behavior, e.g., sustained oscillations. A
famous and rather difficult theorem from the turn of the
century, the Poincare-Bendixson theorem, generalizes your
single-variable analysis to two coupled first-order
equations with arbitrary smooth functions of two variables:
the only nontransient bounded behavior is either constant or
periodic. For three or more coupled first-order equations,
new kinds of nontransient dynamics can occur such as
quasiperiodic behavior (multiple oscillations present with
frequencies whose ratios are irrational numbers) or chaos
which is nontransient bounded dynamics that is neither
periodic nor quasiperiodic.

Challenge&nbsp;29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fission of charged rain
drops
</B>
</FONT>
<p>
Small water drops can sometimes merge into a single bigger
drop (one sees this when rain falls on the windshield of a
car). Fortunately, this mechanism seems to have some upper
limit else we might get hit by rain drops a meter or more in
size which would be most painful (and probably fatal for
small creatures). This raises an interesting physics
question: what determines the size of rain drops in a storm?
<p>
Using an elementary knowledge of electrostatics, you
can determine whether electric charge might play a role
in determining the characteristic size of a rain
drop. (That electrical charges might play a role is
suggested by the occurrence of lightning in many
storms.)  Consider a spherical water drop of
radius&nbsp;R carrying an electrical charge&nbsp;Q that
is uniformly distributed over the surface of the
drop. If this drop splits into two smaller spherical
drops of equal size with each drop having charge Q/2
uniformly distributed over their surfaces, show that
electrostatics favors such a splitting by calculating
the decrease in electrostatic energy caused by fission.
<p>
The total surface area of the two equal smaller drops turns
out to be larger than the surface area of the original drop
and so, because of surface tension which holds a drop
together, it costs energy to split the original
drop. If&nbsp;S denotes the surface tension (which has units
of energy per unit area or Newton/meter), how much energy is
needed to split a drop into two equal smaller drops?
<p>
Now put your two observations together. For a water rain
drop of size R=1&nbsp;mm and approximate surface tension of
S=0.07&nbsp;Newton/meter at room temperature, how many
electrons&nbsp;N would have to be deposited on the drop in
order for the electrostatic energy gained by fission to
offset the energy lost by creating more surface area? Do you
think this would be a reasonable amount of charge to
accumulate by friction as one rain drop bumps against
another in a rain storm?  Is the resulting electric field at
the surface of the drop large in the sense of being close to
the value 30,000&nbsp;volts/meter at which air breaks down?
<p>
Note: Find a copy of the Guiness Book of World Records and
look up the weight of the heaviest hailstone ever found (it
was heavy enough to easily kill an elephant!). Evidently
powerful convection currents in storms can suspend large
weights so that the distribution of rain drop sizes is more
likely determined by stability arguments of the above sort
rather than by the largest mass that can be supported in a
storm.

Consider two cylinders of equal radius and uniform mass

each other and such that their axes are parallel to the
bottom of the board:
<p>
<center>
<img src="two-cylinders.gif" align=center border=2 width=20%>
</center>
<p>
Now for a single cylinder, as soon as the board is tilted up
from the horizontal, the cylinder will start to roll. But
for two cylinders, the tendency for the bottom cylinder to
roll is opposed by a friction force arising from the contact
with the upper cylinder. Calculate the critical angle&nbsp;A
above the horizontal at which the two cylinders will start
to roll down the incline.
<p>
Note&nbsp;1: Assume that the complex friction forces can be
modeled by the usual simplified rules given in an
introductory physics course. If f&nbsp;and&nbsp;N denote the
friction and normal forces respectively at a contact and if
&micro;&nbsp;denotes the coefficient of friction, then
<p>
<center>
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&micro;&nbsp;N,

<center>
   f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&micro;N,

<p>
for bodies in relative motion. For this simple model,
sliding at a contact begins when&nbsp;f first attains its
maximum value of &micro;N. For simplicity, you can also
assume that the friction forces of the cylinders with the
board and with each other are all described by the same
friction coefficient.
<p>
Note&nbsp;2: This kind of problem arises when trying to
understand the dynamics of granular flow, e.g., how grain
flows down a pipe in a silo or sand in an hourglass, or why
sand forms a conical heap with a characteristic angle of
repose. Over the last ten years, granular flow has become a
hot topic in the physics community and many extraordinary
discoveries have been made as researchers started carrying
out careful experiments. 
<p>
Note&nbsp;3: As a harder challenge, see if you can work out
the critical angle for rolling if a third cylinder is
stacked on top of the first two cylinders.

Consider a pendulum consisting of a heavy mass attached to a

the pendulum oscillates in time (is not conserved), going
from zero (when the mass is at its highest say on the left),
increasing to a large positive value as the pendulum swings
tot the right, decreasing to zero as the pendulum reaches
its maximum height on the right, then changing sign and
becoming negative as the pendulum swings to the
left. Similarly, the angular momentum of the mass with
respect to the pivot also oscillates in time. Explain this

the earth's equator than if you were standing at the north

<p>
Note&nbsp;1: Your analysis partially explains why countries
place their rocket launching pads as close to the equator as
possible: the rockets weigh less and so it costs less to
launch them. A more complete analysis requires taking into
account that the earth is not a sphere but an oblate
spheroid, bulging a bit at the equator and being flattened
at the poles. This means that someone on the equator is
further from the center of the earth than at the poles and
so weighs a bit less even in the absence of rotation. This
makes the equator even more favorable for launching rockets.
<p>
Note&nbsp;2: Assuming a spherical rigid earth, see if you

Challenge&nbsp;39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Pre-20th Century
Derivation of the Radius of a Black Hole
</B>
</FONT>
<p>
By the time one has finished a high school or first-year
college course on physics, one has learned about Newton's
laws of motion, about gravitational attraction, that the
kinetic energy of a particle of mass&nbsp;m and speed&nbsp;v
is given by (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup>, and that light travels at a
speed&nbsp;c. Use this pre-20th century knowledge to show
that if a sphere of mass&nbsp;M has a radius&nbsp;R given by
<p>
<center>
  R &nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 M G / c<sup>2</sup> ,
</center>
<p>
where G is the gravitational constant, then a particle on
the surface of this sphere can never attain escape velocity
since it speed would have to exceed the speed of
light&nbsp;c (the maximum speed possible). The sphere is
then effectively an invisible "black hole", since even light
can not escape from its surface.
<p>
Look up the appropriate masses in an astronomy textbook and
calculate this radius for the sun and for the earth and
compare with their actual radii. Also compare the density
(kg per cubic meter) for a solar black hole and compare with
the density of water, 1000&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>.
<p>
Note&nbsp;1: A particle on the surface of some object is
said to attain "escape velocity" if its kinetic energy
exceeds the gravitational potential energy gained by
bringing the particle from infinity to the surface of the
attracting object.
<p>
Note&nbsp;2: This formula for the radius (known as the
Schwarzschild radius) is "correct" in the sense that an
identical formula is found when using Einstein's
general theory of relativity. However, there are
considerable subtleties about the meaning of space,
time, and a radius in the vicinity of the enormous
gravitational field of a black hole and so it is
somewhat of a coincidence that the non-relativistic
formula for kinetic energy and a Newtonian treatment of
gravity yield this particular formula.

could you accelerate in some given direction? Since
light sails don't have keels like water-based sailboats
(which keeps them moving in a straight line), is it
possible to sail upwind towards the sun?

Challenge&nbsp;45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transmission of Light
Through Three Polarized Sunglasses

<p>
Many sunglasses have the property of being "polaroid" which
means that they filter the light in a special way (they
produce what is called "linearly polarized light"). Now a
single pair of polaroid sunglasses is a strong filter and
substantially reduces the intensity of light passing through
it. If you look through two pairs of polaroid sunglasses
simultaneously, you get a further reduction in light
intensity but something funny happens: if you rotate the
second pair of sunglasses while holding the first fixed, you
can reduce the amount of light that gets through almost to
nothing; one sees nearly total darkness.
<p>
So here is something strange to think about: if you hold two
pairs of sunglasses so that almost no light gets through,
and then you insert a <i>third</i> pair of polaroid
sunglasses between the first two pairs, you will now find
that, for certain orientations of the middle (third) pair of
sunglasses, light gets through again. Explain this: how is
it possible that one can add a filter that, by itself,
reduces light intensity but here increases the light
intensity? Can you identify and explain the angle at which
you should hold the middle pair of sunglasses to maximize
the amount of light that gets through?

Challenge&nbsp;46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laws of Friction for
Boats

Introductory physics courses often talk about some simple
empirical "laws" of friction for one solid surface rubbing
against another solid surface. One surprising law is that
the friction force is independent of the surface area of
contact. Another law is that the friction force is
proportional to the normal force that presses one surface
against the other. (See <a href="#challenge33">
Challenge&nbsp;33</a>, "Critical angle of rolling for two
adjacent cylinders on a ramp", which gives you a chance to
test your understanding of these friction laws.)
<p>
So here is an experimental Challenge for the next time you
take a bath in a big bathtub: what are the "laws of
friction" for a solid surface rubbing against a liquid
surface, e.g., a flat-bottom boat pulled along on the
surface of a deep body of water? More specifically:
<ul>
<li>
Is the "friction force" needed to pull a boat through the
water at constant speed proportional to the area of the
boat's bottom?
<li>
Is the friction force for a boat proportional to the normal
force, i.e., to the weight of the boat? You can test this by
taking a toy flat-bottom boat and loading it with varying
amounts of nails.
<li>
Does the friction force needed to pull a boat through the
water depend on the <i>shape</i> of the boat's bottom? If so
what shape will minimize the force for a given area? You
could explore this by cutting out various simple shapes of
equal area out of water-proof cardboard.
<li>
Does the friction force depend on the speed of the boat?
</ul>
For the purposes of this Challenge, qualitative answers are
fine although a quantitative study would certainly be more
interesting and satisfying.
<p>
A historical comment: at my undergraduate University
(Harvard), there was a spring-time "Adam's House Raft Race"
in which students were invited to create their own rafts and
race against each other in Boston's Charles River. This race
stimulated many theoretical and experimental questions about
what kind of raft would be the fastest for 2-4 students who
would sit in or on the raft and paddle like crazy. By the
way, some students went for creativity rather than speed,
e.g. one raft was a two-level bunk bed on foam pillows.

interference experiment that is often discussed in
introductory physics courses to illustrate the fact that
light and sound are wave-like phenomena. Take a
monochromatic but unpolarized beam of light (e.g., using
sunlight, a prism and some lenses) and focus the beam on an
opaque wall with two vertical slits. Also assume that the
widths of the slits and the distance between the slits are
chosen so that one gets a nice interference pattern of light
intensity on some screen beyond the wall. (Basically, the
slits and their separation should be comparable to the
wavelength of the monochromatic light).
<p>
Now consider putting in front of each slit a high quality
linear polarizing filter than can each be rotated around an
axis perpendicular to the direction of light.  Explain what
happens to the interference pattern on the screen as one
linear polarizer is rotated through an angle of
360&nbsp;degrees while the other polarizer is fixed in its

speaker cone.
<p>
Comment: Scientists have recently explored what happens when
a shallow layer of tiny brass balls is put in a cup and this
cup is shaken up and down sinusoidally, just like the poor

Some comments: The purpose of the glass tube is to eliminate
possible air currents so that the perfume spreads from the
vial to your nose only by molecular collisions. You can
assume that the vial is connected to the tube by a sealed
joint so that the tube is the only way that the perfume can
reach your nose. Also assume that you can hold your breath

Challenge&nbsp;52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How high can a tree
grow?
</B>
</FONT>
<p>
The Sequoia pines in California are among the tallest
trees in the world and can attain a height of
110&nbsp;meters. Is this the largest possible height
for a tree on earth? This is not just a biological or
evolutionary question but involves some interesting
physics, much of which is accessible at the level of an
introductory undergraduate course in thermodynamics and
statistical mechanics.
<p>
<center>
<img src="general-sherman-sequoia.jpg" align=center border=2
  alt="General Sherman Sequoia tree (275 feet tall)">
</center>
<p>

<p>
One constraint on the height of a tree is simply the
material strength of the wood, or of the root system that
supports the tree in a vertical position. A tree that is too
tall may break under its own weight or become unstable to
falling over because of strong winds. The latter seems to be
more likely from my own observations of when Hurricane Fran
swept through Durham, North Carolina, in&nbsp;1996, knocking
over many big trees without breaking them. Evidently the
roots were not strong enough to withstand the large forces
and either broke or were pulled out of the ground which had
been softened by the rain. Can you suggest experiments, say
on beams of wood bought at a lumber store or on small trees,
that could help to determine the mechanical limits of a tall
tree? Is the height of a Sequoia determined by the strength
of its wood or of its roots?
<p>
When one looks more into the biology of trees, another
constraint arises that has nothing to do with mechanical
strength, which is the issue of water transport.  Trees get
water primarily from their roots which implies that trees
have to raise the water from their roots through a
gravitational potential&nbsp;Mgh to provide water to leaves
at the top of the tree. (Here&nbsp;M is the mass of a water
molecule in kilograms, g=9.8&nbsp;m/sec<sup>2</sup> is the
acceleration of gravity, and&nbsp;h is the height of the
tree in meters.) How can a Sequoia lift water so high?
<ul>
<li> One possibility is to think of the tree as a tall straw
that sucks the water from its roots up to its highest
branches.  Assuming that the tree can produce a perfect
vacuum in the vicinity of its leaves (don't ask me how),
determine the maximum height in meters for a tree allowed by
suction.  You can assume that the surrounding pressure is
standard atmospheric pressure,
P=10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;N/m<sup>2</sup>.
<p>
<li>
Your answer should be nonsensical, trees would be
limited to unreasonably small heights if they
transported water by suction. An alternative
possibility comes from knowing that tree leaves
"transpire", i.e., give off water moisture through
their leaves. As water evaporates from the leaves, it
effectively pulls up a little bit an entire chain of
water leading from the roots to the leaves, as other
water molecules move into the place of the recently
evaporated ones. More carefully, the difference in
concentration between the saturated water vapor just at
the surface of the leaf and the less saturated water
vapor in the atmosphere beyond the leaf creates a
difference in <i>chemical potential</i> that could
provide the energy to lift a water molecule through the
height of a tree. Given this, calculate the
height&nbsp;h of the largest possible tree and
determine whether trees are limited in height by this
mechanism of water transport.
<p>
Some suggestions: First, let's assume that the entire tree
and its surrounding are in thermal equilibrium at room
temperature (T=293<sup>o</sup>K) so we can try to use ideas
from thermodynamics. The energy&nbsp;Mgh needed to lift a
water molecule through the height of the tree could then be
obtained by the change in chemical potential when a water
molecule in the liquid phase inside the leaf evaporates to
become part of the water vapor away from the
leaf. Thermodynamics books show that the change in chemical
potential for a gaseous molecule that moves from a region of
one concentration to a region of a different concentration
is given by&nbsp;-kTln(r) where&nbsp;r is the ratio of the
concentrations and where k&nbsp;is the Boltzmann constant. A
plausible value for the ratio&nbsp;r might be the relative
humidity, which is found empirically to be about&nbsp;90% in
the vicinity of tree leaves.
<p>
Note that a mechanism based on the change in chemical
potential leads to the testable prediction that trees can
not transport water if the surrounding air is completely
saturated with water vapor.
<p>
<li>
Breaking a chemical bond can release of order one tenth to
one electron volt of energy (which is also the range of
energy available by the absorption of a single photon for
photosynthesis). About how many chemical bonds would have to
be broken in a biochemical reaction to raise a single water
molecule to the top of a Sequoia tree?
<p>
Note: Using energy released by chemical reactions for
biological transport is called "active transport", as
opposed to "passive transport" mechanisms like suction
or transpiration which involve no chemical
reactions. Is active transport a practical possibility
for explaining water transport?  It may help to
appreciate that a 15-meter tall maple tree with about
180,000&nbsp;leaves and total leaf area of about
700&nbsp;meter<sup>2</sup> evaporates of order
200&nbsp;liters of water per hour on average, from
which you can estimate a lower bound on the daily
energy needed for active water transport.
<p>
<li>
Another possibility for raising water is by capillary
action, the tendency of water in a thin vertical tube
to climb up along the walls because of surface tension
and wetting. By balancing the force of surface tension
pulling water up along the walls of a tube against the
force of gravity pulling the mass of a cylindrical
water column down, one can derive the following
relation for the height&nbsp;h to which water will
climb up a tube from its base:
<p>
<center>
     h = 2 S cos(alpha) / (r rho g) ,
</center>
<p>
where h&nbsp;is the height in meters, S&nbsp;is the surface
tension (about 0.07&nbsp;Newton/meter at room temperature),
alpha is the "contact angle" in radians which the water
makes with the tube at the edge of the miniscus, r&nbsp;is
the radius of the column in meters, rho&nbsp;is the density
of water (about 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> at room temperature),
and g&nbsp;is the gravitational acceleration
(9.8&nbsp;m/sec<sup>2</sup>). For glass capillaries and in
small plant channels, the contact angle alpha is
about&nbsp;0 so cos(alpha) can be approximated by&nbsp;1.
<p>
From this relation and these data, estimate the radius of an
internal tube in the tree that could raise water to a height
of 100&nbsp;meters. Is this radius biologically plausible?
</ul>

Before recent breakthroughs in telescope design (which allow

telescope was limited by how large a single plate of glass

to fill a large cylindrical tank with liquid mercury and
rotate the tank around its axis. The shiny surface of the
mercury then deforms into a shape that can be used as a
large and inexpensive telescope mirror.

Work out the design of such a rotating mercury mirror. First

persist forever in its ground state, a positronium atom

Challenge&nbsp;67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distinguishing a
Fast Cooler Star From a Slow Warmer Star
</B>
</FONT>
<p>
Introductory astronomy and physics courses teach the
interesting fact that the color of a remote star can be used
to determine how hot the star is. More precisely, these
courses teach that the light from a star, when passed
through a prism or diffraction grating, produces a special
rainbow called a "blackbody spectrum" whose shape (light
intensity&nbsp;I plotted as a function of the
wavelength&nbsp;&lambda; of light) is "universal" in the
sense that the curve&nbsp;I(&lambda;) depends only on the
temperature&nbsp;T (in kelvin) of the surface of the star
and not at all on the star's chemical composition or
size. Further, the blackbody curve&nbsp;I(&lambda;) has a
single peak and the wavelength &lambda;<sub>max</sub>
corresponding to that peak can be used to deduce the
temperature of the star's surface by something called
"Wien's law", namely
that&nbsp;T&nbsp;=&nbsp;C&nbsp;/&nbsp;&lambda;<sub>max</sub>
where&nbsp;C is some universal constant that applies to all
hot opaque objects.
<p>
The discussions in these introductory courses usually
assume that the star is sitting still in space, but in
fact most stars are moving toward or away from the
Earth, some with a high speed.  So consider a remote
star whose surface temperature is&nbsp;T and assume
that the star is moving directly toward the Earth with
a speed&nbsp;<i>s</i>. Then something called the Doppler
effect will cause the wavelength of each component of
the light to become a little shorter
("blueshifted"). In particular, the
wavelength&nbsp;&lambda;<sub>max</sub> corresponding to the
peak of the star's spectrum will be blueshifted and and
so an astronomer applying Wien's law to the star's
spectrum will deduce an incorrect higher temperature
for the surface of the star since in the relation
T&nbsp;=&nbsp;C&nbsp;/&nbsp;&lambda;<sub>max</sub>, the
wavelength in the denominator is a bit smaller than its
actual value.
<p>
Your challenge: Is there some way for the astronomer to
determine that he or she is looking at a fast cooler
star versus a slow warmer star?
<p>
Note: The spectra from stars often have dark sharp
absorption lines caused by elements in the outer cooler
atmosphere of the star absorbing and then reemitting
parts of the blackbody radiation coming from the star's
surface. It would be straightforward to determine the
speed of the star by measuring how much the wavelengths
of the absorption lines are Doppler shifted compared to
wavelengths of emission lines of the same elements in a
laboratory on Earth. Here the question is how the
Doppler effect modifies the blackbody spectrum and
whether, in principle, observations of just the
blackbody spectrum can be used to deduce the speed
<i>and</i> temperature of a remote glowing object.

Some thoughts: a fish that is at rest with respect to the ocean
and that watches the submarine zoom by will presumably see the
submarine relativistically contract along its length and so the
fish will conclude that the submarine is denser than the
surrounding water and will sink. But sailors in the submarine
will presumably see the water coming toward them at high speed
and so they will conclude that the relativistically contracted
water is denser than the submarine and so the submarine should
rise. So who is right, the fish or the sailors?

Challenge&nbsp;70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does one have to be quiet in
order not to scare the fish away?
</B>
</FONT>
<p>
Fishermen on the shore of a lake or in a stream often try to be
quiet so as not to scare the fish away. Using the fact that the
speed of sound is about 340&nbsp;m/s in air and about
1,500&nbsp;m/s in water, use Snell's law of refraction to
determine how far back from the shore a 1.7&nbsp;m tall fisherman
would have to stand so that the sound of the fisherman's voice
could not be heard by any fish in the water. (Assume that the
sound does not propagate through the ground.) Show also that if
the fisherman stands in the water near the shore, then a fish
would be able to the fisherman's voice no matter where the fish
is located (although more loudly in some places than others).

<p>
If you can throw a baseball with a certain maximum
speed, what would be the maximum speed you can throw a
more massive object like a bowling ball?
<p>
Some data: a baseball has an official mass of about
0.15&nbsp;kg (weight of about 5 oz) while 10-pin
bowling balls start with a mass of about 3.6&nbsp;kg
(8&nbsp;lb). The fastest measured baseball pitch had a

In the book <i>Dear Professor Einstein: Albert
Einstein's Letters to and from Children </i> edited by
Alice Calaprice (Prometheus Books, 2002), a student
Jerry from Richmond, Virginia, wrote the following
letter to Einstein in 1952:
<pre>                     Dear Sir,

		     I am a high school student and have a problem.

		     My teacher and I were talking about Satan. Of course
		     you know that when he fell from heaven, he fell for
		     nine days, and nine nights, at 32 feet a second and was
		     increasing his speed every second.

		     I was told there was a foluma [formula] to it. I know
		     you don't have time for such little things, but if
		     possible please send me the foluma. 

			       Thank you, 
			       Jerry 
</pre>
It seems that Einstein did not reply to Jerry but this
provides an opportunity to do some detective work using physics.
<ol>
<li> Assuming that Satan indeed fell from heaven for
     nine days and nine nights, assuming that Satan's
     initial speed was zero, and assuming that Satan
     fell with a constant acceleration of
     <i>g=</i>9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>, deduce how far from
     Earth heaven must lie and also deduce the speed
     with which Satan struck the surface of the Earth.
<p>
<li> Make a more realistic calculation by assuming that
     the gravitational acceleration&nbsp;<i>g</i> of
     Satan during his fall was not constant but
     decreased with increasing distance from Earth
     according to Newton's universal law of gravity,
     <i>g=GM<sub>E</sub>/d<sup>2</sup></i>,
     where&nbsp;<i>G</i> is the universal gravitational
     constant, <i>M<sub>E</sub></i> is the mass of the
     Earth, and&nbsp;<i>d</i> is the distance of Satan
     to the center of the Earth at a particular
     moment. (Ignore the fact that Satan would also be
     acted on by gravitational forces from the Sun and
     other planets.) What now would be the location of
     heaven from Earth if Satan fell for nine days and
     nine nights under these conditions, and with what
     speed would Satan now strike the Earth's surface?

<p>
You have been wandering in a desert, crazed with thirst for
several days, when you see a truck traveling on a straight
east-west road, where the road is south of your location. In
what direction should you run to maximize your chance to
arrive at the road in time to be picked up by the truck and
be saved?
<p>
For this Challenge, assume that you run at a constant speed
in a straight direction, and that the truck also travels
with a constant speed (whose value you do not know). A hint:
you generally do not want to run to the nearest part of the
road.
<p>
This challenge could also be posed in nautical terms: you
are on a small lifeboat when you see off in the distance a
large ship moving in a straight line at a constant speed. In
what fixed direction should you paddle as fast as you can
(at some constant speed) to maximize your chance of
intercepting the ship so you can be rescued?

Assume that you are a lifeguard at location <i>L</i> on a beach when
you see someone starting to drown at location <i>D</i> in the
water. Assume that you can run on sand (orange region) with a
speed <i>v<sub>s</sub></i> that is substantially larger than the
speed <i>v<sub>w</sub></i> with which you can swim in water (blue
region), and assume that to save the person, you run in a straight
line from&nbsp;<i>L</i> until you reach some point&nbsp;<i>P</i> on
the shore and then swim from&nbsp;<i>P</i> in a straight line until
you reach the drowning person. Determine the location of&nbsp;<i>P</i>
that would let you reach the drowning person in the shortest amount of
time.
<p>
To make the problem specific, assume that the Cartesian
coordinates of the lifeguard
is <i>(x<sub>L</sub>,y<sub>L</sub>)</i>, that the
coordinates of the drowning person
is <i>(x<sub>D</sub>,y<sub>D</sub>)</i> and that the
shoreline has coordinate <i>y=0</i>.
