<LI> <A HREF="http://www.monmouth.com/~jsd/how/htm/author.html"> John
S. Denker</a> has been so kind to host a <A
HREF="http://www.monmouth.com/~jsd/irro/">mirror</a> of these webpages
for US readers. The official site is <A
HREF="http://www.diam.unige.it/~irro">www.diam.unige.it</a> and I will
try to keep the mirror updated without abusing of John's patience.
Please don't bother him with questions related to these pages but contact 
<A HREF="mailto:col@diam.unige.it">me</a> instead.

<LI> During the lecture you will encounter some Java Applets.
They have been developed using the Java Developer Kit (JDK), version 1.1.
If they do not work on your browser, please let me know.

<LI> Be patient ... animations take some time to travel.
If you are not patient at all, you can download a 
<A HREF="archives/irro.tar.gz">.tar.gz</A> or a 
<A HREF="archives/irro.zip">.zip</A>
archive of the whole tree.

<LI> Here you can find a <A HREF="gallery.html">gallery</A> of
some nice photos and images people sent me. I would like to extend this
section, so please email <A HREF="mailto:col@diam.unige.it">me</a> any
image you feel is pertinent to this project. Be sure to include a few
lines of description of what can be seen in the image.

<P> This webpages would never have seen the light without the help from
the following persons I would like to thank:

Marco Colombini</a>
 ... well, after all I think I can put myself on top of the thanks
list ... this work has been done in my spare time :-(<P>

<LI> <A HREF="http://www.idra.unige.it/htbin/phgate?name=&alias=marco">
Marco Galiani</a> who has been, as always, willing to help solving all
(well, almost all) the technical problems.<P>

<LI> <A HREF="mailto:tilman.buntz@physik.uni-muenchen.de">Tilman
Buntz</a>, who is a maths and physics student at the University of
Munchen and is writing a thesis which shall become a guided tour on the
principles of flight for the Deutsches Museum of Munchen for students.
Tilman will use some material from these webpages for his thesis and
proposed himself for arranging the german version of this lecture ... so
choosing to receive all the honours and the blames about it.<P>

<LI> <A
HREF="http://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/sektion/didaktik/rita.htm">Rita
Wodzinski</a>, who teaches physics at the University of Munchen and is
the supervisor of Tilman. Her curiosity on the problem ``longer path =>
higher velocity'' stimulated an interesting discussion. The sections
devoted to the streaklines pattern are the ultimate result of this
discussion and I hope they will help to clarify this common
misconception.<P>

<LI> <A HREF="http://www.monmouth.com/~jsd/how/htm/author.html"> John
S. Denker</a>, who wrote some very enojable <A
HREF="http://www.monmouth.com/~jsd/how/"> pages</A> on the principles of
aerodynamics. John has been very helpful in the building of the code
needed for the streakline animations. A particular thank for his
willingness and for his suggestions.<P>

<LI> <A
HREF="http://www.eng.auburn.edu/department/me/faculty/khodada/profile.htm">
Jay M. Khodadadi</a>, who teaches Fluid Mechanics at Auburn University
and, with the help of Mr. Nitesh Nimkar, did a very good job in checking
the english version of the site. His work went well beyond a mere spell
check so that I really would like to thank him for his
willingness. After all he was the only one of many volunteers who
actually completed the job. Anyway, I take this chance to thank also all
the people who spent some time on this tedious work.<P>

<LI> The students of the course of Fluid Mechanics for Chemical
Engineers, who were the actual reason I started this project. In the
last few years I have mercilessly forced them to carefully study these
pages, asking them to correct, at least, the typos in the italian
version. No hope. (Well, well, actually they found two in the english
version ... hope is the last to die).<P>

<LI> A note to the german version, written by Tilman (I don't
understand a word in german, but I've seen my name in it so ...)<BR>
<U>Vorwort zur deutschen &Uuml;bersetzung:</U> <BR>Hiermit danke ich
nochmal ganz herzlich Marco Colombini f&uuml;r die gro&szlig;z&uuml;gige
Bereitstellung seiner Seiten und Rita Wodzinski, die viel Zeit f&uuml;r
die &Uuml;berarbeitung der &Uuml;bersetzung geopfert hat.<P>
