   I can flex a muscle tightly, or tap my finger lightly,<br>
   It's because I have a brain.<br>
   I can swim in the river, though it's cold and makes me shiver<br>
   Just because I have a brain.<p>
 
I am
really fascinated, to be coordinated,<br>
   It's because I have a brain.<br>
   I can see lots of faces, feel the pain of wearing braces,<br>
   Just because I have a brain. <p>
 
   Oh, I appreciate - the many things that I can do.<br>
   I can taste - a chicken stew, or smell perfume, or touch the dew.<p>
 
   I am heavy with emotion, and often have the notion,<br>
   That life is never plain.<br>
   I have lots of personality, a sense of true reality<br>
   Because I have a brain.<p>

"-1">(sent in by Dr. Linda Walsh, Department of Psychology, University of
Northern Iowa)</font><p>

Well there you have - you've toured the CNS<br>
From your spinal cord to your fine cortex<br>
The brain is divided in 2 hemispheres<br>
With 4 lobes in each - to help you move, see and hear<br>
The meninges are the membranes that keep the brain from gettin' hurt<br>
Don't squeeze the ventricles - CSF will start to squirt<br>
The medulla oblongata makes your heart go tippy-tappy<br>
The limbic system makes you mad, sad or happy<br>
The cerebellum lets you walk without stumbling<br>
And Broca's area - talk without fumbling<br>
The reticular formation wakes you up from sleep<br> 
The hypothalamus tells you when to eat<br>
The brain is neat!<br>
The brain is cool!<br>
The brain's my favorite thing in school!<br>
But now its time, before my memory lapses<br>
To talk about neurons and synapses.<br>

There's a telegram for you ma'am,<br>
And the message is clear:<br>
It says there's something buggin' you<br>
And buzzin' in your ear.<br>
The results can be quite itchy,<br>
So what is your reply?<br>
Tell your arm to swat that fly!<P> 

Hey, there's a telegraph line<br>
You got yours and I got mine.<br>
It's called the "nervous system".<br>
And every body understands<br>
Those telegram commands,<br>
And you know that everybody better listen. <P>

The central nervous system is the brain and the spine:<br>
The brain controls the system,<br>
And the spine is the line.<br>
Telegrams come in to tell what's happening to you,<br>
And telegrams go out to tell your body what to do. <P>

There's a telegram for you sir,<br>
Better read it on the spot:<br>
It says your hand is near a stove<br>
That's very, very hot.<br>
The results can be quite painful,<br>
And there's no time to think...<br>
Quick! Pull that hand away and get it to the sink! <p>

There's a telegraph line<br>
You got yours and I got mine.<br>
It's called the "nervous system".<br>
And every body understands<br>
Those telegram commands,<br>
And you know that everybody better listen. <P>

Your peripheral nerves, they go all out,<br>
Delivering those messages<br>
Your senses send out.<br>
From your hearing and touch<br>
To your sight and taste and smell,<br>
It lets your brain react to all the messages they tell. <P>

There's a telegram for you kid,<br>
And it's at an awful time:<br>
It says you've got to go on stage<br>
And you've forgot your lines.<br>
You're gonna be embarassed,<br>
'Cause this telegram's a rush,<br>
Your heart starts beatin' faster... And you blush! <P>

Hey, there's a telegraph line<br>
You got yours and I got mine.<br>
It's called the "nervous system".<br>
And every body understands<br>
Those telegram commands,<br>
And you know that everybody better listen. <p>

The autonomic system has a hold of you,<br>
Controlling automatically,<br>
Some things that you do.<br>
Your breathing and your heartbeat<br>
Just go on, naturally<br>
And when you're scared, you're nerves rev up the speed! <p>

Hey, there's a telegraph line<br>

(sung to the tune of "Clementine" <font
size="-1">sent in by Leah B., a graduate student in elementary
education at Long Island Univ.  Leah gives credit to Bruce Campbell for
composing this song.)</font><p>

Use your dendrites,<BR>   
Use your dendrites,<BR>
To connect throughout your brain.<BR>
Take in info, analyze it,<BR>
Grow some new ones<BR>
Unrestrained.<P>

Axons send out<BR>
Neurotransmitters<BR>
To the dendrites all around<BR>
Across the synapse<BR>
Jumps the impulse<BR>
New ideas can now abound.<P>

Stimulation<BR>
Is what the brain needs<BR>
To make dendrites stretch and grow.    <BR>
New connections<BR>
Make us smarter<BR>
In what we think and what we know.<P>

Use your dendrites,<BR>
Use your dendrites,<BR>
To connect throughout your brain<BR>
Take in info, analyze it,<BR>
Grow some new ones<BR>
Unrestrained.<p>

<center>Two songs from third grade student, Caleb W., Cumming Elementary 
<BR>Cumming, Georgia.  Teacher: Stephanie Silvestro</center><p>
(Sung to the tune of "I've Been Working on the Railroad."<BR>Caleb got 
some help from his Mom with this song.<BR>The song explains how to make a 
neuron from food.)<P>

We are going to make a neuron...a neuron we can eat.<P>
We will use the peanut butter to make the myelin sheath.<P>
Can't you see the axon made from the graham stick.<P>
The synaptic terminals are the pretzel sticks.<P>

soma-cell body<BR>
soma-cell body<BR>
soma made from marsh-mall-ow.<P>

Add candy straws<BR>
for the dendrites.<BR>
Now you have a neu--ron.<P>

(This next song is sung to the tune of "Oh Christmas Tree.")<P>

Oh neuron, oh neuron how lovely are your dendrites.<BR>
Oh neuron, oh neuron how lovely is your soma.<BR>
The nucleus, the axon, the myelin sheath, the terminals.<BR>
Oh neuron, oh neuron how lovely are your dendrites.<P>
