<H1>The Mind of God</H1>
<H1>Paul Davies</H1>
Simon &amp; Schuster 1992
<DIV CLASS="attrib">A book review by <a href="http://danny.oz.au/">Danny Yee</a> &#0169; 1993 http://dannyreviews.com/</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="main">
<EM>The Mind of God</EM> is one of the recent offerings from physics
populariser Paul Davies.  Unlike his other books it contains very little
in the way of actual physics, being instead about foundational
metaphysical and epistemological issues.  While it is written for a
popular audience and makes no assumptions of prior knowledge, the reader
without any maths/physics/computer science background is likely to find
the barrage of new ideas heavy going.  The philosophically naive reader
is also likely to end up confused by the plethora of different ideas
being thrown at them.  However they should not be put off, as the ideas
and issues covered are arguably <STRONG>intrinsically</STRONG> perplexing.  (Perhaps the
only reason they don't confuse practicing philosophers is because the
latter are already extremely confused :-).  
<P>
<EM>The Mind of God</EM> begins with physics, looking at different theories of
the creation of the universe, the nature of physical laws and the
possibility of a theory of everything.  This leads on naturally to a
discussion of mathematics and its philosophical foundations, and then on
to computer science, and in particular the nature of computation and its
relationship to physical processes.  Then it's back to mathematics and
its relationship with physics.  After this things get more philosophical,
with a look at various arguments for a "God" or at least something
"outside" the universe.  The final chapter is a look at mysticism and
contains a suggestion that non-rational (religious and mystical)
approaches to understanding may be able to go beyond the limits of
physics.  
<P>
The bulk of the material is expository, but Davies does come to two
broad conclusions.  The first is that there is something special about
the universe, the second is that there is something special about us.
"We are truly meant to be here." is the closing sentence of the book.  I
do not find the arguments for either of these at all convincing.  I am
tempted to play the positivist and argue that neither of his claims
<STRONG>means</STRONG> anything (because I do not understand how anything can be
"special" except to or for an observer, and hence cannot see how one can
argue that the universe is special without first assuming the existence
of a God), but there are other problems with these claims.
<P>
The argument that there is something mysterious about the universe is
based on our ability to understand the universe at all and on its
apparent operation according mathematical rules.  The former is a
natural consequence of our existence as intelligent animals, and the
explanation of this is the task of evolutionary biology.  (See below,
and consult any work on the evolution of consciousness and cognition.)
The latter is only significant if there is an alternative, and I would
argue that anything with structure can have that structure represented
mathematically, and anything that "exists" must connect to other things
(perhaps there are invisible, intangible, non-interacting pink elephants
out there, but they don't concern me) and hence must exhibit some kind
of structure.
<P>
The laws of physics are indeed such as to allow life to exist, but it
is not clear that we can deduce anything about our own significance
from that.  Even given the right laws of physics it seems that the
existence of Homo sapiens (or indeed multicellular life) on this planet
is a contingent fact of natural history and by no means inevitable.
(See Stephen Jay Gould's <EM>Wonderful Life</EM>, for example.)  Also, given
that we do not even know what Omega (the average mass density of the
universe) is to within an order of magnitude, it seems hard to argue
for the sensitivity of the existence of life to the "initial
conditions" of the universe!
<P>
The long progression through the arguments for the existence of God -
the good old ontological argument, the cosmological argument and the
argument from design all making their appearance - is a little odd.
Davies provides more than adequate explanations for the failure of each
of the different arguments as he proceeds, yet at the end has somehow
given the impression that all the arguments put together, despite having
been individually refuted, give some kind of support to there being a
"God".
<P>
Davies' restriction of his view to the physical and mathematical sciences
and his complete neglect of the historical sciences is also worrying.
To me his ideas seem a strange mixture of Cartesian reductionism on
the one hand and mystical idealism on the other.  He attempts to reduce
epistemology to physics, mathematics and computer science, and then, when
these don't seem to be able to explain everything, resorts to appeals to
mysticism and religion.  There is more to the universe (and epistemology)
than physics and mathematics deal with.  Instead of looking to mysticism
or religion for information about this or about our place in the universe,
however, I would suggest trying anthropology and evolutionary biology.
<P>
These qualms about Davies' broader conclusions aside, <EM>The Mind of
God</EM> is a brilliant exposition of foundational philosophical issues in
mathematics, physics and computer science.  It is recommended reading
for anyone interested in the big philosophical questions.
