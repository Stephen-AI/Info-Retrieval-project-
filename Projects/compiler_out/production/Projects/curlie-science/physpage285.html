<h1>Gravity is Cool, or, Why our Universe is Hospitable to Life</h1>
<h2>By Freeman J. Dyson, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New
Jersey, Oppenheimer lecture, given at the University of California,
Berkeley, California, 9 March 2000</h2>
<h3>
1. Gravity is Cool
</h3><p>
First I would like to say thankyou to Professor Chemla and to everyone
else who was involved in inviting me here. Thankyou for your
hospitality, and for giving me the chance to meet and talk with your
students and faculty. I am sorry that my visit is so brief that I met
only a few of you.
</p><p>
I am a physicist by trade, but this is supposed to be a lecture for
the whole campus, so I won&#39;t talk about physics. I will talk about
astronomy and biology, subjects which I have always been interested in
although I am not an expert. Everybody knows roughly what astronomy
and biology are about. Astronomy is about the universe and biology is
about life. I am interested in seeing how the universe and life fit
together. Since I am not an expert in either sub&#39;ect, I can say
things that the experts might find outrageous. Don&#39;t be surprised
if some of the things I say turn out to be wrong. In science it is
better to be wrong than to be vague. Often we find the right way only
after we tried all the wrong ways first. That is why it is fun to be a
scientist. You don&#39;t need to be afraid of being wrong.
</p><p>
I decided to talk about three questions we all can understand, even if
we can&#39;t answer them. Here are my three questions. Why is the
universe friendly to the evolution of life? How did life begin? And
where should we be looking for evidence? I will talk first about a
general framework of ideas into which the search for life in the
universe can fit. Then I will talk about the origins of life, a
subject about which we are all equally ignorant. Then I will end with
a bet about where we might find it.
</p><p>
Let us look first at the astronomical universe. We know that the
universe is friendly to the evolution of life. Otherwise we would not
be here to discuss it. But we don&#39;t know why the universe is so
friendly. To make it possible for life to evolve either on the earth
or anywhere else, two things were essential. There had to be violent
events with very short time-scales, supernova explosions to bring the
chemical elements essential to life out of the insides of stars where
they are made, collisions between little planets crashing together to
form big planets. And there had to be long quiet periods in which
slowly evolving life was sheltered from violence. Time in our universe
has always had two faces, the quick violent face and the slow gentle
face, the face of the destroyer and the face of the preserver. How did
these two faces of time come to coexist in a single universe?
</p><p>
In the old days, people who thought about the natural history of the
earth were divided into catastrophists and
uniformitarians. Catastrophists believed that time molds the earth by
means of sudden catastrophes, the most famous example being Noah&#39;s
flood. Uniformitarians believed that time works slowly, molding the
earth by long-continued action of the same processes that we observe
at work today. We now know that both sides in the debate were
right. Time loves to sit quietly for millions of years, and then to
pounce suddenly in a single hour of fury. Nothing is permanent, but
the illusion of permanence can last for a long time. We see in the
channeled scablands of Washington State the traces of a flood more
violent than Noah&#39;s, when a huge lake formed by the melting
Canadian ice-cap broke through an ice-dam and destroyed everything in
its path as it roared down to the sea. And we see, a few hundred miles
to the north in Canada, the Burgess shale, where delicate fossils of
our ancient ancestors have been marvelously preserved in rocks that
are five hundred million years old.
</p><p>
When we move from the earth to the heavens, the contrast between the
quiet and the stormy faces of time becomes even starker. In our quiet
little corner of the universe, the sun and moon and planets serenely
ride in their orbits, the stars shine steadily for billions of
years. Elsewhere, in places remote from us in space or time, sudden
cataclysms fill the sky with violence as heavenly bodies are born or
die. The birth of our moon was such a cataclysm, more than four
billion years ago, when the earth was young. Another planet, smaller
than the earth but larger than the moon, collided obliquely with the
earth. In a few minutes the incoming planet was torn apart, half of it
plunged into the earth, the other half formed a ring of orbiting
debris which condensed to make our moon. Whatever structures existed
on the earth before the collision were totally obliterated. The heat
of impact made the earth white-hot, with an atmosphere of vaporized
rock. Afterwards the earth cooled down and became the planet that we
know. No object of comparable size has collided with it in more recent
times. Later impacts were smaller and did only superficial damage. But
we see, far away across the universe, cataclysms vastly more violent
than the collisions of planets. We see supernova explosions in which
the core of a massive star collapses in a fraction of a second and the
envelope of the star is ejected into space. We know that such an
explosion must have occurred in our neighborhood shortly before the
earth and the sun were born, to produce the mixture of heavy atoms
that we see on earth today. And we see other cataclysms even more
abrupt and energetic than supernova explosions. We call these events
gamma-ray bursts, but nobody knows how or why they happen. The
universe is full of cataclysms. Luckily for us, they are separated by
immense distances and by eons of time. During the intervals between
cataclysms, time shows her quiet face and life can survive and
prosper.
</p><p>
The existence of life depends crucially on the fact that time has
these two faces, the quiet and the violent, cleanly separated from
each other. The violent face created the stuff that we are made
of. The quiet face sustains us and allows us to evolve. We need to
understand the reasons why these faces exist. There are two main
reasons, one superficial and one fundamental. The superficial reason
is that the universe is extravagantly large. Distances are so great
that accidental collisions hardly ever happen. This is why the sun
with its family of planets can run like a perfect clock, with orbits
undisturbed by close encounters with alien sta,rs, for billions of
years. We are protected from cataclysms by the sheer size of the
interstellar spaces.
</p><p>
The more fundamental reason for the two faces of time is the fact that
the universe is dominated by the force of gravitation. Gravitational
energy is quantitatively the largest reserve of energy, and
qualitatively the least disordered. It carries zero disorder and zero
heat. Because of its superior quality, gravitational energy can change
easily and irreversibly into other forms of energy. Other forms of
energy are associated with disorder and heat, but Gravitational energy
is cool. Gravity is cool in both senses of the word. This is why
gravitational energy can drive turbines in a hydroelectric power-station
with almost a hundred percent efficiency, while other kinds of
power-station, powered by coal or oil or natural gas or uranium,
struggle to reach fifty percent. The gravitational energy of the ice
in the high Canadian ice-cap during the last ice age waited quietly
for a hundred thousand years, until the thaw and the break in the
ice-dam released it. As soon as it was released, it changed into the
turbulent energy of the flood that excavated a trillion tons of rock
and created the scablands. Similarly, the gravitational energy of
the planet that collided with the earth stayed cool for millions of
years, and then suddenly changed into heat at the moment of impact
when the moon was born. All over the universe, when conditions are
right for gravitational energy to be released, it can change instantly
into heat and radiation, and a cataclysm results. The two faces of
time are a consequence of the two faces of gravitation. Gravitation is
the ordering principle that holds our earth together as a stage for us
to walk on, and gravitation is the ultimate reservoir of energy that
can smash our world to pieces.
</p><p>
The best popular account of the science that explains how the universe
can be friendly to life is a book, <q>Creation of the Universe</q>, by
the Chinese astronomers Fang Li Zhi and Li Shu Xian. The book was
translated into English and published by World Scientific Publishing
Company of Singapore in 1989. Fang Li Zhi is the famous dissident
astronomer now living in exile in the United States. I particularly
recommend Chapter 6, with the title <q>How Order was born of
Chaos</q>. This tells the same story that I am telling you today, but
with more detail and more depth.
</p><h3>
2. The Garbage-bag World
</h3><p>
Now I come to the second question, how life might have actually begun,
either here or on Mars or anywhere else. There are two strongly
divergent views of the state of affairs when life began. One view is
the RNA world, which says that life began with replicating
molecules. RNA, ribonucleic acid, is a big molecule, a modified form
of DNA, more flexible but equally capable of replicating itself. The
RNA world has molecules like RNA coming together by chance,
replicating themselves and organizing the replication of other
molecules to make the first living creatures. The other view is the
garbage-bag world, which says that life began with little bags of
garbage, membranes made of oily scum or other common chemicals that
like to form membranes, enclosing volumes of dirty water containing
miscellaneous garbage. The RNA world is the orthodox theory, the party
line of the molecular biology community, accepted by the majority of
expert biochemists and geneticists. The experts love RNA because it is
marvelous stuff to do experiments with. You can put RNA into a
test-tube and watch it replicate and evolve. The experts believe in
the RNA world even more strongly since Thomas Cech discovered in 1986
that RNA can not only replicate itself but can also act as an enzyme
to catalyze reactions between other molecules. RNA enzymes are called
ribozymes and are an important part of the genetic machinery in all
modern cells. The RNA world is a beautiful scene, with busy little
ribozymes cooperating to organize the beginnings of life.
</p><p>
The garbage-bag world is not so elegant and not so widely accepted. It
was originally proposed by the Russian biologist Oparin in the
nineteen-twenties. Unfortunately Oparin later fell into ill repute,
because he was a prominent academician at the end of his life during
the bad times when Lysenko was destroying Russian genetics. Oparin was
a friend of Lysenko, and did not lift a finger to save the geneticists
when Lysenko was denouncing them to Stalin and making sure that they
were imprisoned or killed. The prevalent opinion among western
biologists was that, since Oparin was a bad guy, his theory must have
been bad too. Fortunately, bad guys sometimes produce good
theories. One of the main proponents of the garbage-bag theory today
is Doron Lancet, a chemist at the Weizmann Institute in Israel. I
myself prefer it, partly because I like to be in the minority, and
partly because I find it chemically more plausible. The idea of the
garbage-bag world is that a random collection of molecules in a bag
may occasionally contain catalysts that cause synthesis of other
molecules that act as catalysts to synthesize other molecules, and so
on. Very rarely a collection of molecules may arise that contains
enough catalysts to reproduce the whole population as time goes
on. The reproduction does not irieed to be precise. It is enough if
the catalysts are maintained in a rough statistical fashion. The
population of molecules in the bag is reproducing itself without any
exact replication. While this is happening, the bag may be growing by
accretion of fresh garbage from outside, and the bag may occasionally
be broken into two bags when it is thrown around by turbulent
motions. The critical question is then, what is the probability that a
daughter bag produced from the splitting of a bag with a
self-reproducing population of molecules will itself contain a
self-reproducing population? When this probability is greater than one
half, a parent produces on the average more than one functional
daughter, a divergent chain reaction can occur, the bags containing
self-reproducing populations will multiply, and life of a sort has
begun.
</p><p>
The life that begins in this way is the garbage-bag world. It is a
world of little proto-cells that only metabolize and reproduce
themselves statistically. The molecules that they contain do not
replicate themselves exactly. Reproduction is not the same thing as
replication. Cells can reproduce but only molecules can replicate. The
Darwinian process of evolution by natural selection does not require
exact replication to be effective. Darwin had never heard of DNA or
RNA or exact replication when he developed his theory of
evolution. Statistical reproduction is a good enough basis for natural
selection. As soon as the garbage-bag world begins with crudely
reproducing proto-cells, natural selection will operate to improve the
quality of the catalysts and the accuracy of the reproduction. It
would not be surprising if a million years of selection would produce
proto-cells with many of the chemical refinements that we see in
modern cells.
</p><p>
Life is not one thing but two, metabolism and replication, and the two
things are logically separable. Metabolism is the normal chemical
activity of a living cell. Replication is the precise copying of a
gene. There are accordingly two logical possibilities for life&#39;s
origins. Either life began only once, with the functions of
replication and metabolism already present and linked together from
the beginning, or life began twice, with two separate kinds of
creatures, one kind arising first, capable of metabolism without exact
replication, the other kind coming much later, capable of replication
without metabolism. If life began once, the beginning was something
like the RNA world. If life began twice, the first beginning was the
garbage-bag world, with creatures containing all kinds of
molecules. These garbage- bag creatures might have existed
independently for a long time, perhaps as long as one or two billion
years, eating and growing and gradually evolving a more and more
efficient metabolic apparatus. The second beginning might have been
with replicating parasites made of RNA, arriving later and preying
upon the garbage-bag creatures. The parasites could use the products
of the garbage-bag metabolism as life-support to help them achieve
their own replication.
</p><p>
Another feature of the universe that has been essential to the
evolution of life is symbiosis. Symbiosis is the coming together of
two creatures, after they have been detached from each other and have
evolved along separate paths for a long time, so as to form a combined
creature with behavior not seen in the separate components. Symbiosis
is a familiar concept both in biology and astronomy. In biology,
almost all higher plants and animals make use of symbiotic bacteria to
perform many of their functions. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the roots
of soybean plants and cellulose-digesting bacteria in the stomachs of
cows are two well- known examples. Lynn Margulis collected the
evidence to prove that symbiosis played an even more fundamental role
in the evolution of modern cells from bacteria. She proved that the
mitochondria and chloroplasts that are essential components of modern
cells were once independent free-living creatures. They first invaded
the ancestor of the modern cell from the outside and then became
adapted to living inside. The combined cell then learned to coordinate
the activities of its component parts, so that it acquired a
complexity of structure and function that neither component could have
evolved separately. In this way symbiosis allows evolution to proceed
in giant steps. A symbiotic creature can jump from simple to
complicated structures much more rapidly than a creature evolving by
the normal processes of step-by-step mutation. I am suggesting that
the earlier jump from garbage-bag creatures to cells with a modern
genetic apparatus also came about by symbiosis. The nucleic acid
creatures, originating as parasites within the garbage-bag creatures,
gradually learned to cooperate with their hosts. The garbage-bag
creatures learned to tolerate the parasites and to exploit their
capacity for exact replication. Together, the two components of the
symbiosis created a modern cell that was so efficient, both in
metabolism and in replication, that it wiped out all earlier forms of
life.
</p><p>
Symbiosis is also a dominant factor in the evolution of the non-living
universe. Symbiosis is as frequent in the sky as it is in
biology. Astronomers are accustomed to talking about symbiotic
stars. The basic reason why symbiosis is important in astronomy is
again the double mode of action of gravity. When gravity acts upon a
uniform distribution of matter occupying a large volume of space, the
first effect of gravity is to concentrate the matter into lumps
separated by voids. The separated lumps then differentiate and evolve
separately along different evolutionary histories. They become
distinct types of object. But then, after a period of separate
existence, gravity acts in a second way to bring lumps together and
bind them into pairs. The binding into pairs is a sporadic process
depending on chance encounters. It usually takes a long time for a
given lump to be bound into a pair. But the universe has plenty of
time. After a few billion years, a large fraction of objects of all
sizes become bound in symbiotic systems, either in pairs or in
clusters. Once they are bound together by gravity, dissipative
processes of various kinds tend to bring them closer together. As they
come closer together, they interact with one another more strongly and
the effects of symbiosis become more striking.
</p><p>
Examples of astronomical evolution caused by symbiosis are to be seen
wherever one looks in the sky. On the largest scale, symbiotic pairs
and clusters of galaxies are very common. When galaxies come into
close contact,, their internal evolution is often profoundly
modified. A common sign of symbiotic activity is an active galactic
nucleus. An active nucleus is seen in the sky as an intensely bright
source of light at the center of a galaxy. The various varieties of
active galactic nuclei commonly arise from the symbiotic effects of
other galaxies nearby. The probable cause of the intense light is gas
falling into a black hole at the center of one galaxy as a result of
the gravitational perturbations caused by another galaxy. It happens
frequently that big galaxies swallow small galaxies. Nuclei of
swallowed galaxies are observed inside the swallower, like mouse-bones
in the stomach of a snake. This form of symbiosis is known as galactic
cannibalism.
</p><p>
But this talk is supposed to be about life, and I must not digress
further into astronomy. Let me come back to the subject of life. From
the point of view of life, the most important example of astronomical
symbiosis is the symbiosis of the earth and the sun. The whole system
of sun and planets and satellites, the system which we call the Solar
System, is a typical example of astronomical symbiosis. At the
beginning, when the Solar System was formed, the sun and the earth
were born with totally d]fferent chemical compositions and physical
properties. The sun was made mainly of hydrogen and helium, the earth
was made of heavier elements such as oxygen and silicon and iron. The
sun was physically simple, a sphere of gas heated at the center by the
burning of hydrogen into helium and shining steadily for billions of
years. The earth was physically complicated, partly liquid and partly
solid, its surface frequently transformed by phase-transitions of many
kinds. The symbiosis of these two contrasting worlds made life
possible. The earth provided chemical and environmental diversity for
life to explore. The sun provided physical stability, a steady input
of energy on which life could rely. The combination of the earth&#39;s
variability with the sun&#39;s constancy provided the conditions in
which life could evolve and prosper.
</p><p>
In addition to the sun and the planets and their satellites, the solar
system also contains a large number of asteroids and comets, smaller
objects gravitationally bound to the sun but not sharing in the
orderly motions of the planets. The asteroids and comets are an
important part of the symbiosis that binds the system together. Since
they have disordered motions, they occasionally collide with planets
and produce catastrophic disturbances of the local environment. Traces
of these impacts are visible on the surface of the earth, and even
more visible on the moon. A few years ago we could see the huge scars
on the face of Jupiter caused by the impact of comet
Schumacher-Levy. Impacts large enough to affect the whole earth and
cause extinctions of species on a global scale occur about once in a
hundred million years. The random obliteration of ecologies by major
impacts has been a part of the history of life on earth since the
beginning. It is likely that these catastrophes drove evolution
forward by destroying species that were too well adapted to static
environments, making room for species that were adaptable to harsher
and more rapidly changing conditions. Without the occasional impact
catastrophe to reward adaptability, it is unlikely that our own
species would have emerged. We are among the most adaptable of
species, offspring of a symbiosis in which sun, planets, asteroids and
comets all played an essential part.
</p><p>
The most famous experiment exploring the origin of life was done by
Stanley Miller in Berkeley in 1953. Miller filled a flask with a
reducing atmosphere composed of methane, ammonia, hydrogen and water,
passed electric sparks through it and collected the reaction
products. He found a thin soup containing a remarkably high fraction
of interesting organic compounds. He also tried the experiment in an
oxidizing atmosphere, and in a neutral atmosphere composed of
nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water. Other people have repeated the
experiment with many variations. The results are always the same. With
a reducing atmosphere you get plenty of interesting organic
chemicals. With an oxidizing or neutral atmosphere you do not.
</p><p>
We now know that the earth&#39;s reducing atmosphere, if it ever
existed, had disappeared by the time the heavy meteoritic bombardment
of the earth ceased, about 3.8 billion years ago. So Miller&#39;s
beguiling picture of the origin of life, in a warm little sunlit pond
full of dissolved chemicals under a reducing atmosphere, has been
discredited. Recently, a new beguiling picture has come to take its
place. The new picture has life originating in a hot, deep, dark
little hole on the ocean floor. Four experimental discoveries came in
rapid success on to make the new picture seem plausible. First, the
discovery of abundant life existing today around vents on the
mid-ocean ridges, several kilometers below the surface, where hot
water emerging from deep below is discharged into the ocean. The water
entering the ocean is saturated with hydrogen sulphide and metallic
sulphides, so that it provides a reducing environment independent of
the atmosphere above. Second, the discovery that bacterial life exists
today in strata of rock deep underground, in places where contact with
surface life is unlikely. In some cases, the deep underground bacteria
do not belong to any previously known species. Third, the discovery of
strikingly life-like phenomena observed in the laboratory, when hot
water saturated with soluble iron sulphides is discharged into a cold
water environment. The sulphides precipitate from the water as
membranes and form gelatinous bubbles. The bubbles look like possible
precursors of living cells. The membrane surfaces adsorb organic
molecules from solution, and the metal sulphide complexes catalyze a
variety of chemical reactions on the surfaces. Fourth, the discovery
that many ancient lineages of bacteria are thermophilic, that is to
say, specialized to live and grow in hot environments. Many of them
are found today in hot springs, often in places where the water
temperature is close to boiling.
</p><p>
These four lines of evidence, from ocean ridges, from deep oil-well
drilling, from labora- tory experiments and from genetic analysis,
combine to make the picture of life originating in a hot deep
environment credible. Since we know almost nothing about the origin of
life, we have no basis for declaring any possible habitat for life to
be likely or unlikely until we have explored it. The picture of life
beginning in a deep hot crevice in the earth is purely speculative and
in no sense proved. It has an important corollary. If it is true, it
implies that the origin of life was largely independent of conditions
on the surface of the planet. And this in turn implies that life might
have originated as easily on Mars as on the earth. Thomas Gold is an
astronomer friend of mine who is constantly pouring out new ideas. Not
all of his ideas are crazy. He recently wrote a book called <q>The
Deep Hot Biosphere</q>. He postulates a deep, hot blosphere still
existing in the crust of the earth. He presents evidence that the deep
biosphere may contain as much biomass as the surface biosphere with
which we are familiar. He remarks, <q>If in fact such life originated
at depth in the earth, there are at least ten other planetary bodies
in our solar system that would have had a similar chance for
originating microbial life</q>. I don&#39;t know which ten objects
Gold had in mind. Certainly Mars, Europa, Titan and Triton would be on
the list. Europa is a moon of Jupiter, Titan is a moon of Saturn,
Triton is moon of Neptune. All of them are cold on the surface, but
warm underneath where life might be hiding.
</p><p>
There is a possible analogy between the origin of life and the origin
of elaborate body- plans in higher organisms. Half a billion years
ago, after life had existed for about three billion years, there was a
sudden efflorescence of elaborate body-plans. The efflorescence is
known as the <q>Cambrian explosion</q>, and produced in a geologically
short time all the major body-plans from which modern higher organisms
evolved. In the Burgess shale in Canada, the fossils of these newly
evolved creatures are marvelously preserved. Stephen Gould describes
them in his book, <q>Wonderful Life</q>. Something must have happened
shortly before the Cambrian epoch to make the genetic programming of
elaborate body-plans possible. What might have happened was the
invention of <q>indirect development</q>, the system by which an
embryo sets aside a, package of cells that are destined to grow into
an adult, the body-plan of the adult having no connection with the
body-plan of the embryo. The advantage of this system is that the
embryo provides life-support to the adult during the vulnerable stages
of its early growth, while the adult is free to evolve elaborate and
fine-tuned structures unconstrained by existing structures of the
embryo. Three California paleontologists, Davidson, Peterson and
Cameron, have collected evidence that the great majority of existing
body-plans arose from indirect development. This fact was overlooked
until recently because the two best-known body-plans, the vertebrate
and the arthropod, are exceptions to the rule, Humans and lobsters
grow by direct development from embryo to adult. The vertebrates and
arthropods, the two most successful groups of animals, probably began
like the others with indirect development, but later evolved a
short-cut system of direct development with the adult body-plan
growing directly from the embryo. If the system of indirect
development came first, it means that multicellular organisms evolved
by a two-step process. The first step was the evolution of embryonic
forms of limited complexity, lacking the genetic machinery to program
specialized structures. The second step was the evolution of adult
forms with the modern system of genetic controls, and with
life-support provided by the embryo. I am proposing that the early
evolution of life followed the same two-step pattern as the evolution
of higher organisms. First came the embryonic stage of life, cells
with functioning metabolism but without any genetic apparatus, unable
to evolve beyond a primitive level. Second came the adult stage, cells
with genetic machinery allowing the evolution of far more fine-tuned
metabolic pathways, and again with life-support provided by the first
stage while the second stage evolved.
</p><p>
To me, one of the most attractive features of the garbage-bag theory
of the origin of life is that it shows life following the same
pattern, a major step in evolution divided into two separate
&#39;umps, at three crucial periods of its history. First, the period
of origins about four billion years ago, when the two jumps were
metabolism and replication. Second, the evolution of modern cells
according to Margulis, about two billion years ago, when the two jumps
were parasitic invasion and symbiosis. And, third, the evolution of
higher organisms, about half a billion years ago, when the two jumps
were the embryo and the package of cells that grew into an adult. In
each of the three revolutions, the first stage relied on crude and
simple modes of inheritance, and the second stage jumped to new levels
of sophistication in the translation of genetic language into
anatomical structure.
</p><p>
About a hundred and fifty million years after the Cambrian explosion,
life made one of its greatest jumps when it moved from the ocean onto
land. To survive on land it had to invent lungs, and weight-carrying
bones, and a dry impermeable skin that could prevent loss of
water. The first animals that came ashore did not yet have impermeable
skins. They were the amphibians, animals like frogs that hatch from
eggs in the water and live only part of their lives on land. They
desiccate and die if they sit too long in sunshine. It took another
fifty million years for the descendants of the amphibians to become
reptiles fully adapted to living on land. The reptiles with their
impermeable skins spread all over the earth and made it their
home. The liberation of life from the ocean made possible all the
later inventions that make the land beautiful, fur and feathers and
forests and flowers.
</p><h3>
3. Looking for Life
</h3><p>
For the last part of this talk, I move from the past to the
future. When I look at things from the point of view of an
astronomer,, the four hundred million years that elapsed since life
escaped from the ocean until now is a short time. That was perhaps
only the first jump in another revolution that needs two &#39;umps to
be complete. The first jump was from the ocean onto the land. The
second jump will be from the land into space. The revolution will only
be complete when life has escaped from this planet and made the
universe its home. We are beginning the second &#39;ump now with our
exploring of the planets and our quick trips to the moon. But for a
long time, so long as we depend on spacecraft and spacesults to stay
alive in space, we shall be amphibians. We can survive in space for a
limited time, and we must return to our home planet to breathe air
under an open sky. This amphibian phase may last for a few hundreds of
years, while the life that we carry with us away from earth is still
confined to artificial habitats.
</p><p>
After that, perhaps sooner than most people expect, we shall breed
plants and animals tfiat do not need to be confined but are adapted to
living wild in space. The jump from breathing air to living in a
vacuum is no greater than the jump from breathing water to breathing
air. Plants and animals will need some genetic engineering to be at
home in a vacuum. Plants will need new organs of photosynthesis that
produce liquid or solid peroxides instead of oxygen gas. Animals will
need new organs of respiration to take in oxygen in the form of
peroxides instead of from air. Instead of lungs, animals would have an
organ like a liver that dissociates peroxides slowly into molecular
oxygen and feeds the oxygen into the blood. Both plants and animals
will need stronger skin to hold internal pressure and prevent their
blood from boiling. The vapor pressure of water at blood temperature
is quite small, so the skin will not need to be thick to hold it. In
cold places far from the sun, animals will need thicker layers of fur
and plants will need thicker layers of bark to provide thermal
insulation. This will be a challenge for plant and animal breeders,
but with a mastery of the techniques of genetic engineering they
should be able to do it. When they have done it, life will have moved
again from the age of amphibians to the age of reptiles. The second
jump of the new revolution will be complete, and life will be on its
way to the next phase of evolution. Life adapted to vacuum will evolve
to create new ecologies on all the worlds where sunlight and the
chemical elements essential to life are to be found.

I am not an astronomer myself, but I like to talk with astronomers. I
see the universe through the eyes of the astronomers. Everywhere I
look, I see beauty. But everything we see, except our own planet, is
dead. And one planet with life is more beautiful than a whole universe
dead. The universe would be far more beautiful and meaningful if it
were full of life, if life were spread out over those millions of
worlds. Somehow life must find a way to spread and make a home for
itself in every corner of the universe, just as it made a home for
itself in every corner of this planet. Perhaps our job is to be the
midwives, to help the living universe to be born. I believe in
space-travel, not as an end in itself, but as a means to bring the
universe to life.
</p><p>
Human beings did not have to exist for life to escape from the
earth. There might have been other midwives, other species that
developed intelligence and tools to give a start to space-travel. It
might have been possible for life to spread over the universe even
without intelligent midwives. Pieces of rock are occasionally blasted
away from Mars by a comet or asteroid impact and arrive on Earth
without being destroyed. We have picked up more than a, dozen
Mars-rocks in Antarctica and other places on Earth. If Mars had
possessed living inhabitants, some Martian creatures might have
survived the voyage and made their home on Earth. Perhaps we are their
descendants. Organisms from Earth might occasionally arrive in the
same way on Mars. No place in the universe is totally isolated from
its neighbors. The universe has plenty of time. The universe could
have waited long enough to see life moving out from Earth by the
natural processes of comet impacts and meteorite infall. If we take
responsibility for spreading life through the universe only speeding
up the natural processes.
</p><p>
Today the rockets that we use to get from earth into space are
absurdly expensive. The public believes that space-travel will always
be too expensive for ordinary people. But this need not always be
so. Space-travel need not always be a spectator sport, with a small
elite of stars paid for by the millions who stay on the ground and
watch the show on television. To make space-travel cheap in the
future, we need public highways into space. To be accessible to the
general public, space-travel must be about a hundred times cheaper
than it is to-day. The cost of launching payload into space should be
reduced from ten thousand dollars a pound to a hundred dollars a
pound. This sounds hard to do, but it may be possible if we develop
radically new methods of propulsion, leaving the source of energy on
the ground so that each spacecraft does not need to carry its own
fuel. The source of energy for launching payloads from the ground into
space should be like a public highway, serving anyone who arrives at
the site with a spacecraft and is willing to pay the toll.
</p><p>
There are several possible ways of building a public highway into
space. A laser beam pointing from the ground up into the sky can be a
public highway. Two years ago in Princeton we saw a film of the first
flight of Leik Myrabo&#39;s Lightcraft Technology Demonstrator, a
little toy model of a laser-propelled spacecraft. Myrabo is a
professor at Rensellaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York
State. His model rose three feet into the air, not so high as the
first flight of the Wright brothers in December 1903. More recent
Lightcraft flights flew higher, but the first flight was the decisive
step. The first flight demonstrated that laser propulsion is possible,
&#39;ust as the 1903 flight demonstrated that human heavier-than-air
flight was possible. The sound-track accompanying the film of the
Lightcraft made a noise like a machine-gun, as the laser fired
high-intensity pulses at a rate of ten per second. The vehicle has a
little fish-shaped body with a blunt nose and a shiny reflecting dish
around its waist. It weighs two ounces and has a diameter of six
inches. Each laser pulse is focussed by the dish and heats the air at
the focus to a high temperature, causing a shock-wave that propels the
model upward. The average power in the beam is ten kilowatts. Myrabo
borrowed the laser from the United States Air Force at White Sands,
New Mexico. Last year Myrabo was back in Princeton with a film of the
Lightcraft flying 75 feet up a laser beam. It flies stably up to 75
feet. To fly higher he will need a better laser. A simple calculation
shows that if it takes a ten kilowatt laser to lift a two-ounce
space-craft off the ground, it will take a one gigawatt laser to lift
a five-ton spacecraft. The five-ton spacecraft could fly all the way
up the laser-beam into space. Using laser-heated water as propellant,
a spacecraft with a take-off weight of five tons should be able to
carry two tons of propellant and a useful payload of at least a ton,
enough for a couple of passengers and their baggage. A one gigawatt
laser will be expensive, but it is not absurd. We already have
hundred-megawatt lasers. The laser is the easy part of a
laser-propulsion system. The hard part is the engine. We don&#39;t yet
know how to design the engine for a full-scale system.
</p><p>
It took seventy years to go from the Wright brothers&#39; Flyer One of
1903 to the modern air-transport system with huge numbers of
commercial aircraft flying routinely all over the world. Perhaps it
will take another seventy years to go from Myrabo&#39;s Lightcraft
Technology Demonstrator to a laser-propelled public highway system
with huge numbers of spacecraft traveling routinely to destinations in
orbit and on the moon and beyond. At each destination there must be a
massive infrastructure comparable with a major airport and including
the associated industries and hotels. All this will take a long time,
measured on a human time- scale, but a short time, measured on an
astronomical timescale.
</p><p>
Building public highways is difficult because they become cheap only
when they are constantly used. To keep a public highway into space
busy, we need a hundred thousand launches per year, roughly one every
five minutes. The first users of the highway will be big corporations
and governments who can afford to pay for its initial cost. After it
has been built, it will be available for ordinary people, for private
groups who go into space at their own expense, like the Pilgrim
Fathers who rented a second-hand boat and sailed froi-n England to
America in 1620. The ordinary people will not only take themselves and
their families into space. They will take plants and animals too. By
that time, we will have plants and animals genetically engineered to
live wild in strange places. People will spread life with them
wherever they go.
</p><p>
Cheap space-travel will sooner or later be developed. There is no law
of physics that decrees that space-travel must always be expensive. So
far as the laws of physics are con- cerned, if one measures the cost
of moving into space by the amount of energy required, the cost of
launching a person from Earth into space should be no greater than the
cost of a commercial flight from New York to Tokyo. But to bring the
cost of space-launches down to the cost of commercial air travel
requires a huge volume of traffic. Space-travel will only be cheap
when millions of people can use it. And millions of people can only
use it when there are cities in the sky to which travelers can go. The
growth of space-habitats and the decline of costs will be a slow
process. Much can be done in a hundred years, but not enough to have a
major impact on the social problems of Earth. The expansion of life
into space will not come in time to solve the problems of our
grandchildren. When it finally comes, it will be a mixed blessing for
humanity. Only one thing is certain. Once life escapes from this
little planet into the universe, there will be no stopping it. It will
keep on moving and changing. It will go on its way, with or without
our help. Like good midwives, we should step aside and watch it grow.
</p><p>
Finally, this talk has a punch-line, and here it is. I come now at
last to the third of my three questions. Where should we be looking
for evidence of life? Dreams of a possible future have practical
consequences for the present. Things that for us are in the
speculative future may have happened in the past somewhere else. When
we begin a serious search for life existing elsewhere in the universe,
we should keep in mind the possibility that life elsewhere is already
adapted to living in vacuum. For life adapted to living in vacuum,
planets are not the most likely habitat. Life would be more likely to
be found on small bodies such as asteroids or comets, places where
gravity is weaker and moving from one world to another is easier. For
life adapted to vacuum, a planet would be a death-trap. A planet for
them would be like a deep well full of water for a human child. A
swarm of small ob&#39;ects like the Kulper Belt, the ring of icy
worlds that we see &#39;ust outside the orbit of Neptune, provides far
more habitable surface area than all the planets together. It would be
a friendlier place for vacuum-life to flourish. We see many stars like
Beta Pictoris with clouds of debris orbiting around them. These stars
have much more real estate in their Kulper Belts than we have in
ours. When we are searching for evidence of alien life, we should not
look only at planets. Planets may be the most likely places for life
to begin, but they are not the most likely places for life to be found
in the sky. In searching for evidence of life, as in all branches of
astronomy, you have the best chance of making important discoveries if
you look where other people are not looking. I am not saying that we
should give up looking for evidence of life on Mars, only that we
should look in other places too, Europa and the Kuiper Belt and giant
molecular clouds. Wherever there is water and carbon and nitrogen and
starlight, life might already be teeming. I am willing to bet even
money that when the first alien life is found it will not be on a
planet. This is a bet which I will be happy either to win or to lose.

On March 9, Professor Freeman Dyson, from the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, New Jersey, delivered the annual Oppenheimer
lecture at the University of California, Berkeley to a packed
auditorium. The following day Dr. Dyson was kind enough to join the
Society of Physics Students for a post-colloquium
<q>conversation</q>. I asked Dr. Dyson if it would be possible to make
the text of his talk available to those who were unable to attend the
lecture. Generously, he provided me with his hardcopy notes, which I
have transcribed here. Professor Dyson asks only that this text not be
used for commercial purposes, and it should be regarded as being
copyrighted by him.

Here&#39;s what the SPS had to say about Professor Dyson: <q>Professor
Dyson helped formulate QED with Richard Feynman and Julian
Schwinger. Besides his extensive work in quantum field theory,
Prof. Dyson has worked in mathematics, astrophysics, climatology,
public policy, evolution, and many other fields. (<q>The main theme of
his life is the pursuit of variety.</q>&#8212;from the
about-the-author blurb in his 1992 book, <cite>From Eros to
